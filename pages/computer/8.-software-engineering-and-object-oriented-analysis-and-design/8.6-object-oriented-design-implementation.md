# 8.6 Object-Oriented Design Implementation

Object-oriented design implementation involves the process of translating the design models into executable code. This phase connects the conceptual aspects of the object-oriented design to real-world programming. It consists of mapping class diagrams, collaboration diagrams, and other design artifacts into code while ensuring that the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) are adhered to.

***

### **1. Programming and Development Process**

The programming and development process in object-oriented design implementation involves the following steps:

* **Understanding the Design**: Before writing code, developers need to fully understand the design models, including the class diagram, collaboration diagram, and use cases.
* **Modular Development**: Code is implemented in smaller, manageable modules that correspond to design components. These modules are later integrated to form the complete system.
* **Iterative Development**: The implementation process is often iterative. Code is written, tested, and refined in cycles to ensure correctness and maintainability.
* **Version Control**: During the implementation process, developers use version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively.

This phase bridges the gap between the conceptual design and the actual software that will be executed.

***

### **2. Mapping Design to Code**

Mapping design to code is the process of translating design elements (like classes and methods) into actual programming constructs.

* **Class Mapping**: Each class in the design is mapped to a class in the code. The attributes and methods of the class are defined in the code, and the relationships between classes are translated into appropriate coding structures such as inheritance, composition, and aggregation.
* **Method Mapping**: Methods defined in the design are mapped to functions or methods in the code. The design should specify method names, arguments, return values, and functionality, which developers then implement in the corresponding language.
* **Design Patterns Mapping**: Design patterns used in the design phase (e.g., Singleton, Factory) are also mapped to corresponding code structures.

The goal of mapping is to ensure that the design’s structure, logic, and behavior are faithfully translated into the code.

***

### **3. Creating Class Definitions from Design Class Diagrams**

A **class definition** in code corresponds to the classes defined in the design class diagram.

* **Class Declaration**: A class is created in the code with the `class` keyword (depending on the programming language).
* **Attributes**: The attributes of the class, which are shown in the design, are declared as fields in the class. Their data types are also specified in the code.
* **Methods**: The methods (also known as functions or procedures) are created within the class based on the design class diagram. These methods define the behaviors of the class.
* **Encapsulation**: The class definition includes appropriate access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`) to ensure that encapsulation is maintained. This restricts the access to internal details and exposes only necessary functionality.

Example (in Python):

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Attribute
        self.age = age  # Attribute

    def greet(self):  # Method
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
```

***

### **4. Creating Methods from Collaboration Diagram**

Collaboration diagrams show how objects interact to perform a task, and this interaction must be mapped to code.

* **Message Passing**: In the collaboration diagram, objects communicate by passing messages. These messages are mapped to method calls in the code. When one object needs to call another object’s method, it translates to invoking a method on the target object.
* **Methods and Parameters**: Collaboration diagrams typically specify the method names and the parameters. The implementation should use these names and parameters to define the methods in the classes.
* **Object Interactions**: The design diagrams often illustrate sequences of messages. These should be implemented by calling methods on objects in the correct sequence in the code.

Example (in Python):

```python
class Car:
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Driver:
    def drive(self, car):
        car.start_engine()  # Message passing (method invocation)
```

In this example, the **Driver** object sends a message to the **Car** object by invoking the `start_engine()` method.

***

### **5. Updating Class Definitions**

During the implementation phase, it is common for the design to evolve based on testing and new requirements. When this happens, the class definitions need to be updated.

* **Adding Methods**: As the codebase grows, new methods might be required to meet new functionality or requirements. These should be added to the corresponding classes.
* **Modifying Attributes**: Sometimes the attributes of a class need to be adjusted. This might involve adding new attributes or changing data types to accommodate new features or behaviors.
* **Refactoring**: Refactoring involves restructuring the code without changing its external behavior. This could be done to improve readability, reduce complexity, or optimize performance.

***

### **6. Classes in Code**

In object-oriented programming, classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. The implementation of classes involves:

* **Constructors and Destructors**: Constructors initialize an object’s state, while destructors handle cleanup when an object is destroyed. These are crucial for managing memory and resources.
* **Method Implementation**: Each method defined in the design is implemented in code. These methods define the behavior of objects.
* **Inheritance**: Classes can inherit from other classes, allowing for shared functionality. The child class can override or extend methods from the parent class.
* **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexibility and scalability in the design.

***

### **7. Exception and Error Handling**

Handling exceptions and errors is crucial to ensuring that the program runs smoothly and can handle unexpected situations gracefully.

*   **Exceptions**: Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of the program. Object-oriented programming languages typically provide mechanisms to handle exceptions through try-catch blocks or equivalent constructs.

    Example (in Python):

    ```python
    try:
        x = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Cannot divide by zero!")
    ```
*   **Custom Exceptions**: Developers can define custom exceptions to handle specific error conditions that may arise in the system. These custom exceptions should be designed based on the system’s needs.

    Example (in Python):

    ```python
    class NegativeAgeError(Exception):
        pass

    def set_age(age):
        if age < 0:
            raise NegativeAgeError("Age cannot be negative")
        return age
    ```
* **Error Handling in Methods**: During method implementations, it’s important to handle errors that may arise from invalid inputs, external systems (e.g., databases, network), or other runtime issues.

***

### **Conclusion**

Object-oriented design implementation is the phase where design diagrams and models are translated into actual working code. It involves defining classes, methods, and attributes based on the design, ensuring correct interactions between objects, and handling errors through exception management. This phase is iterative, with developers constantly updating and refining the code to ensure that it meets the design specifications and works as intended. The focus is on implementing object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, while also ensuring the system is maintainable, reusable, and scalable.
