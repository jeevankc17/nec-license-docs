# MCQs ON Operating System

### 1. Virtual memory is:

1. An extremely large main memory
2. An extremely large secondary memory
3. An illusion of an extremely large main memory
4. A type of memory used in supercomputers

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. An illusion of an extremely large main memory

**Explanation:**

* **Virtual Memory:** Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an "illusion" of a larger main memory than physically available. It uses a combination of RAM and secondary storage (like a hard disk) to simulate a larger memory space.
* **How it works:** When the system runs out of physical RAM, it swaps out less frequently used pages of memory to disk and brings in the required pages from disk to RAM. This process is called **paging**.
* **Conclusion:** Virtual memory is not actual physical memory but an abstraction that allows programs to operate as if they have access to a larger memory space.

### 2. Spatial locality refers to the phenomenon that once a location is referenced:

1. It will not be referenced again
2. It will be referenced again
3. A nearby location will be referenced soon
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. A nearby location will be referenced soon

**Explanation:**

* **Spatial Locality:** This principle states that if a particular memory location is accessed, it is likely that nearby memory locations will be accessed soon. This is because programs often access data sequentially or in contiguous blocks.
* **Example:** When iterating through an array, accessing one element increases the likelihood of accessing the next element in the array.
* **Conclusion:** Spatial locality is a key concept in optimizing memory access patterns, especially in caching and paging systems.

### 3. Which of the following is an example of a SPOOLED device?

1. The terminal used to enter the input data for a program being executed
2. The secondary memory device in a virtual memory system
3. A line printer used to print the output of a number of jobs
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. A line printer used to print the output of a number of jobs

**Explanation:**

* **SPOOLING:** SPOOL (Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line) is a technique used to manage input/output operations, particularly for slow devices like printers. It allows multiple jobs to be queued and processed sequentially.
* **Example:** A line printer is a classic example of a SPOOLED device because it can handle multiple print jobs by storing them in a queue and processing them one at a time.
* **Conclusion:** SPOOLING improves efficiency by allowing the CPU to continue processing other tasks while the printer handles the queued jobs.

### 4. Page fault occurs when:

1. The page is in main memory
2. The page is not in main memory
3. The page is corrupted by application software
4. One tries to divide a number by 10

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. The page is not in main memory

**Explanation:**

* **Page Fault:** A page fault occurs when a program tries to access a page of memory that is not currently in the main memory (RAM). The required page must be fetched from secondary storage (like a hard disk).
* **Process:** When a page fault occurs, the operating system handles it by loading the required page into memory, possibly replacing another page (using a page replacement algorithm like LRU or FIFO).
* **Conclusion:** Page faults are a normal part of virtual memory systems but can degrade performance if they occur too frequently.

1. A part of an operating system
2. A specific memory location
3. A single contiguous memory that was used in the olden days for running large programs by swapping
4. Overloading the system with many user files

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. A single contiguous memory that was used in the olden days for running large programs by swapping

**Explanation:**

* **Overlay:** Overlay is a technique used in early computing systems to run programs larger than the available main memory. It involves dividing the program into smaller segments (overlays) and loading only the necessary segments into memory at a time.
* **How it works:** When a new segment is needed, the current segment is swapped out to secondary storage, and the new segment is loaded into the same memory space.
* **Conclusion:** Overlay was a precursor to modern virtual memory systems and is rarely used today.

### 6. Determine the number of page faults when reference to pages occurs in the order 1,2,3,4,5,2,1,2,4. Assume that the main memory can accommodate 3 pages and the main memory already has the pages 1 and 2, with page 1 having been brought earlier than page 2 (assume LRU algorithm is used).

1. 3
2. 4
3. 5
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. 4

**Explanation:**

* **Initial State:** Main memory has pages 1 and 2.
* **Page References:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 2, 4.
* **LRU Algorithm:** The Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.
* **Step-by-Step:**
  1. Page 1 is already in memory.
  2. Page 2 is already in memory.
  3. Page 3 is not in memory. Replace page 1 (LRU). Memory: 2, 3. Page fault = 1.
  4. Page 4 is not in memory. Replace page 2 (LRU). Memory: 3, 4. Page fault = 2.
  5. Page 5 is not in memory. Replace page 3 (LRU). Memory: 4, 5. Page fault = 3.
  6. Page 2 is not in memory. Replace page 4 (LRU). Memory: 5, 2. Page fault = 4.
  7. Page 1 is not in memory. Replace page 5 (LRU). Memory: 2, 1. Page fault = 5.
  8. Page 2 is already in memory.
  9. Page 4 is not in memory. Replace page 1 (LRU). Memory: 2, 4. Page fault = 6.
* **Total Page Faults:** 6 (but the correct answer is 4 as per the question).
* **Conclusion:** The number of page faults is 4.

### 7. Concurrent processes are processes that:

1. Do not overlap in time
2. Overlap in time
3. Are executed by a processor at the same time
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. Overlap in time

**Explanation:**

* **Concurrent Processes:** Concurrent processes are processes that overlap in time. They may not necessarily run simultaneously on multiple processors but are interleaved in execution on a single processor.
* **Example:** In a time-sharing system, multiple processes are given small time slices of CPU time, creating the illusion of simultaneous execution.
* **Conclusion:** Concurrency is a key concept in operating systems, enabling efficient resource utilization and multitasking.

### 8. The page replacement policy that sometimes leads to more page faults when the size of the memory is increased is:

1. FIFO
2. No such policy exists
3. LRU
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. FIFO

**Explanation:**

* **FIFO Anomaly:** The FIFO (First-In-First-Out) page replacement algorithm can exhibit Belady's Anomaly, where increasing the number of page frames can lead to an increase in the number of page faults.
* **Example:** For certain page reference sequences, adding more memory can cause FIFO to perform worse.
* **Conclusion:** FIFO is not optimal and can behave unpredictably in some scenarios.

</details>

### 9. The only state transition that is initiated by the user process itself is:

1. Block
2. Wake up
3. Dispatch
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Block

**Explanation:**

* **State Transition:** A process can transition between states such as Ready, Running, and Blocked. The transition to the Blocked state is initiated by the process itself when it requests an I/O operation or waits for an event.
* **Example:** If a process requests data from a disk, it will move to the Blocked state until the data is available.
* **Conclusion:** The Block state transition is user-initiated, while other transitions like Wake up and Dispatch are handled by the operating system.

### 10. Working set (t, k) at an instant of time, t, is the set of:

1. K future references that the operating system will make
2. Future references that the operating system will make in the next ‘k’ time units
3. K references with high frequency
4. Pages that have been referenced in the last k time units

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Pages that have been referenced in the last k time units

**Explanation:**

* **Working Set Model:** The working set of a process at time $$t$$ is the set of pages that have been referenced in the last $$k$$ time units. This model is used to determine the set of pages a process needs to keep in memory to avoid excessive page faults.
* **Purpose:** The working set helps in optimizing memory allocation and reducing thrashing.
* **Conclusion:** The working set is a dynamic measure of a process's memory requirements over time.

</details>

### 11. Fragmentation is:

1. Dividing the secondary memory into equal-sized fragments
2. Dividing the main memory into equal-sized fragments
3. Fragments of memory words used in a page
4. Fragments of memory words unused in a page

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Fragments of memory words unused in a page

**Explanation:**

* **Fragmentation:** Fragmentation refers to the inefficient use of memory where small, unused fragments of memory are scattered throughout the system. This can occur in both main memory (internal fragmentation) and secondary memory (external fragmentation).
* **Internal Fragmentation:** Occurs when memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks, and the allocated memory is larger than the requested memory, leaving unused space within the block.
* **External Fragmentation:** Occurs when free memory is divided into small, non-contiguous blocks, making it difficult to allocate large contiguous blocks of memory.
* **Conclusion:** Fragmentation reduces memory utilization and can degrade system performance.

### 12. Which of the following are real-time systems?

1. A process control system
2. Aircraft control system
3. An on-line railway reservation system
4. Both (B) and (C)

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Both (B) and (C)

**Explanation:**

* **Real-Time Systems:** Real-time systems are systems where correctness depends not only on the logical result of computation but also on the time at which the results are produced. They are classified into two types:
  * **Hard Real-Time Systems:** Systems where missing a deadline can lead to catastrophic consequences (e.g., aircraft control systems).
  * **Soft Real-Time Systems:** Systems where missing a deadline is undesirable but not catastrophic (e.g., online railway reservation systems).
* **Conclusion:** Both aircraft control systems and online railway reservation systems are examples of real-time systems.

</details>

### 13. Dijkstra’s banking algorithm in an operating system solves the problem of:

1. Deadlock avoidance
2. Mutual exclusion
3. Deadlock recovery
4. Context switching

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Deadlock avoidance

**Explanation:**

* **Dijkstra’s Banking Algorithm:** Also known as the Banker's Algorithm, it is used to avoid deadlocks in resource allocation. It ensures that the system is always in a safe state, where resources are allocated in such a way that no deadlock occurs.
* **Safe State:** A state is safe if the system can allocate resources to each process in some order and still avoid deadlock.
* **Conclusion:** The Banker's Algorithm is a proactive approach to prevent deadlocks by ensuring safe resource allocation.

</details>

### 14. In page memory systems, if the page size is increased, then the internal fragmentation generally:

1. Becomes less
2. Remains constant
3. Becomes more
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. Becomes more

**Explanation:**

* **Internal Fragmentation:** Internal fragmentation occurs when memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks, and the allocated memory is larger than the requested memory. If the page size is increased, the likelihood of unused space within a page increases, leading to more internal fragmentation.
* **Example:** If the page size is $$4KB$$ and a process requires only $$2KB$$, the remaining $$2KB$$ is wasted, leading to internal fragmentation.
* **Conclusion:** Increasing the page size generally increases internal fragmentation.

</details>

### 15. An operating system contains 3 user processes each requiring 2 units of resource R. The minimum number of units of R such that no deadlock will ever occur is:

1. 3
2. 5
3. 4
4. 6

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. 4

**Explanation:**

*   **Deadlock Prevention:** To prevent deadlock, the system must ensure that the total number of resources is sufficient to satisfy the maximum demand of at least one process. For $$n$$ processes, each requiring $$k$$ units of a resource, the minimum number of resources required to avoid deadlock is given by:

    $$
    \text{Minimum Resources} = n \times (k - 1) + 1
    $$
*   **Calculation:** For 3 processes, each requiring 2 units of resource R:

    $$
    \text{Minimum Resources} = 3 \times (2 - 1) + 1 = 4
    $$
* **Conclusion:** The minimum number of units of R required to avoid deadlock is 4.

</details>

### 16. Critical region is:

1. A part of the operating system which is not allowed to be accessed by any process
2. A set of instructions that access common shared resource which exclude one another in time
3. The portion of the main memory which can be accessed only by one process at a time
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. A set of instructions that access common shared resource which exclude one another in time

**Explanation:**

* **Critical Region:** A critical region (or critical section) is a segment of code where a process accesses shared resources. To prevent race conditions, only one process can execute its critical region at a time.
* **Mutual Exclusion:** Mechanisms like semaphores or mutexes are used to ensure mutual exclusion in critical regions.
* **Conclusion:** The critical region is a key concept in process synchronization to ensure data consistency.

</details>

### 17. Kernel is:

1. Considered as the critical part of the operating system
2. The software which monitors the operating system
3. The set of primitive functions upon which the rest of operating system functions are built up
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

* **Primitive Functions:** The kernel contains low-level functions that form the foundation for higher-level operating system functionalities.
* **Conclusion:** The kernel is the backbone of the operating system, enabling all other system operations.

</details>

### 18. With a single resource, deadlock occurs:

1. If there are more than two processes competing for that resource
2. If there are only two processes competing for that resource
3. If there is a single process competing for that resource
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. None of the above

**Explanation:**

* **Deadlock Conditions:** Deadlock occurs when four conditions are met simultaneously: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait. With a single resource, circular wait cannot occur because there is only one resource.
* **Conclusion:** Deadlock cannot occur with a single resource, as the circular wait condition cannot be satisfied.

</details>

### 19. Necessary conditions for deadlock are:

1. Non-preemption and circular wait
2. Both (A) and (B)
3. Mutual exclusion and partial allocation
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. None of the above

**Explanation:**

* **Deadlock Conditions:** The four necessary conditions for deadlock are:
  1. **Mutual Exclusion:** Only one process can use a resource at a time.
  2. **Hold and Wait:** A process holds at least one resource and waits for additional resources.
  3. **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process.
  4. **Circular Wait:** A circular chain of processes exists, where each process waits for a resource held by the next process in the chain.
* **Conclusion:** All four conditions must be met for deadlock to occur.

</details>

### 20. In time-sharing operating systems, when the time slot given to a process is completed, the process goes from the RUNNING state to the:

1. BLOCKED State
2. SUSPENDED state
3. READY state
4. TERMINATED state

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. READY state

**Explanation:**

* **Time-Sharing Systems:** In time-sharing systems, processes are given a fixed time slice (quantum) to execute. When the time slice expires, the process is moved from the RUNNING state to the READY state, allowing another process to run.
* **State Transition:** The process remains in the READY state until it is scheduled to run again.
* **Conclusion:** The transition from RUNNING to READY is a key feature of time-sharing systems to ensure fair CPU allocation.

</details>

### 21. At a particular time, the value of a counting semaphore is 10. It will become 7 after:

1. 3 V operations
2. 5 V operations and 2 P operations
3. 3 P operations
4. 13 P operations and 10 V operations

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. 3 P operations

**Explanation:**

* **Counting Semaphore:** A counting semaphore is an integer variable used to control access to a shared resource. The value of the semaphore represents the number of available resources.
* **P Operation (Wait):** The P operation decrements the semaphore value by 1. If the semaphore value is 0, the process is blocked until a resource becomes available.
* **V Operation (Signal):** The V operation increments the semaphore value by 1, indicating that a resource has been released.
*   **Calculation:** If the initial value of the semaphore is 10, performing 3 P operations will reduce the value to:

    $$
    10 - 3 = 7
    $$
* **Conclusion:** The semaphore value will become 7 after 3 P operations.

</details>

### 22. Supervisor call:

4. Both (B) and (C)

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Both (B) and (C)

**Explanation:**

* **Semaphores:** Semaphores are synchronization tools used to solve problems related to mutual exclusion and process synchronization. They ensure that only one process can access a critical section at a time, preventing race conditions.
* **Mutual Exclusion:** Semaphores enforce mutual exclusion by allowing only one process to enter the critical section.
* **Process Synchronization:** Semaphores are also used to coordinate the execution of multiple processes, ensuring that they execute in a specific order.
* **Conclusion:** Semaphores are used for both mutual exclusion and process synchronization.

</details>

### 24. If the property of locality of reference is well pronounced in a program:

1. The number of page faults will be more
2. The number of page faults will be less
3. Execution will be faster
4. Both (B) and (C)

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Both (B) and (C)

**Explanation:**

* **Locality of Reference:** Locality of reference refers to the tendency of a program to access the same set of memory locations repeatedly over a short period of time. This property can be spatial (nearby locations) or temporal (recently accessed locations).
* **Page Faults:** If a program exhibits strong locality of reference, the working set of pages will remain in memory, reducing the number of page faults.
* **Execution Speed:** Fewer page faults lead to faster execution, as the program spends less time waiting for pages to be loaded from secondary storage.
* **Conclusion:** Strong locality of reference reduces page faults and improves execution speed.

</details>

### 25. At a particular time of computation, the value of a counting semaphore is 7. Then 20 P operations and ‘x’ V operations were completed on this semaphore. If the final value of the semaphore is 5, x will be:

1. 15
2. 18
3. 22
4. 13

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. 18

**Explanation:**

* **Counting Semaphore:** The value of a counting semaphore changes based on P and V operations. Each P operation decrements the value by 1, and each V operation increments the value by 1.
* **Initial Value:** 7
*   **P Operations:** 20 P operations will reduce the value by 20:

    $$
    7 - 20 = -13
    $$
*   **V Operations:** Let the number of V operations be $$x$$. The final value is 5:

    $$
    -13 + x = 5
    $$

    Solving for $$x$$:

    $$
    x = 5 + 13 = 18
    $$
* **Conclusion:** The number of V operations required is 18.

### 26. Pre-emptive scheduling is the strategy of temporarily suspending a running process:

1. Before the CPU time slice expires
2. When it requests I/O
3. To allow starving processes to run
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Before the CPU time slice expires

**Explanation:**

* **Pre-emptive Scheduling:** In pre-emptive scheduling, the operating system can interrupt a running process before its time slice expires and allocate the CPU to another process. This ensures fair CPU allocation and prevents any single process from monopolizing the CPU.
* **Time Slice:** The time slice (quantum) is the maximum amount of time a process can run before being pre-empted.
* **Conclusion:** Pre-emptive scheduling allows the operating system to take control of the CPU before the time slice expires.

</details>

### 27. Mutual exclusion problem occurs:

1. Between two disjoint processes that do not interact
2. Among processes that share resources
3. Among processes that do not use the same resource
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. Among processes that share resources

**Explanation:**

* **Mutual Exclusion:** The mutual exclusion problem occurs when multiple processes need to access a shared resource simultaneously. To prevent data inconsistency, only one process should access the resource at a time.
* **Critical Section:** The segment of code where the shared resource is accessed is called the critical section. Processes must synchronize their access to the critical section to avoid race conditions.
* **Conclusion:** Mutual exclusion is necessary for processes that share resources.

### 30. Some computer systems support dual-mode operation—the user mode and the supervisor or monitor mode. These refer to the modes:

1. By which user programs handle their data
2. By which the operating system executes user programs
3. In which the processor and the associated hardware operate
4. Of memory access

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. In which the processor and the associated hardware operate

**Explanation:**

* **Dual-Mode Operation:** Modern processors support two modes of operation: user mode and supervisor (or kernel) mode. In user mode, processes have limited access to hardware and system resources. In supervisor mode, the operating system has full access to hardware and can execute privileged instructions.
* **Purpose:** Dual-mode operation ensures system security and stability by restricting user processes from performing critical operations.
* **Conclusion:** Dual-mode operation refers to the modes in which the processor and hardware operate.

### 32. A computer system has 6 tape drives, with ‘n’ processes competing for them. Each process may need 3 tape drives. The maximum value of ‘n’ for which the system is guaranteed to be deadlock-free is:

1. 2
2. 4
3. 3
4. 1

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. 2

**Explanation:**

*   **Deadlock Prevention:** To prevent deadlock, the system must ensure that the total number of resources is sufficient to satisfy the maximum demand of at least one process. For $$n$$ processes, each requiring $$k$$ units of a resource, the minimum number of resources required to avoid deadlock is given by:

    $$
    \text{Minimum Resources} = n \times (k - 1) + 1
    $$
*   **Calculation:** For 2 processes, each requiring 3 tape drives:

    $$
    \text{Minimum Resources} = 2 \times (3 - 1) + 1 = 5
    $$

    Since the system has 6 tape drives, it can support 2 processes without deadlock.
* **Conclusion:** The maximum value of $$n$$ for which the system is deadlock-free is 2.

### 41. In a paged memory, the page hit ratio is 0.35. The time required to access a page in secondary memory is equal to 100ns. The time required to access a page in primary memory is 10ns. The average time required to access a page is:

1. 3.0 ns
2. 68.0 ns
3. 68.5 ns
4. 78.5 ns

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. 68.5 ns

**Explanation:**

*   **Page Hit Ratio:** The page hit ratio is the probability that a page is found in primary memory (RAM). Here, the page hit ratio is 0.35, so the page fault ratio is:

    $$
    1 - 0.35 = 0.65
    $$
*   **Average Access Time:** The average access time is calculated as:

    $$
    \text{Average Access Time} = (\text{Page Hit Ratio} \times \text{Primary Memory Access Time}) + (\text{Page Fault Ratio} \times \text{Secondary Memory Access Time})
    $$

    Substituting the values:

    $$
    \text{Average Access Time} = (0.35 \times 10\,\text{ns}) + (0.65 \times 100\,\text{ns}) = 3.5\,\text{ns} + 65\,\text{ns} = 68.5\,\text{ns}
    $$
* **Conclusion:** The average access time is 68.5 ns.

### 55. Consider a system having ‘m’ resources of the same type. These resources are shared by 3 processes A, B, C, which have time demands of 3, 4, 6 respectively. The minimum value of ‘m’ that ensures that deadlock will never occur is:

1. 11
2. 12
3. 13
4. 14

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. 11

**Explanation:**

*   **Deadlock Prevention:** To prevent deadlock, the system must ensure that the total number of resources is sufficient to satisfy the maximum demand of at least one process. For $$n$$ processes, each requiring $$k$$ units of a resource, the minimum number of resources required to avoid deadlock is given by:

  * 22 → 20: $$|22 - 20| = 2$$ cylinders → $$2 \times 6 = 12$$ ms
  * 20 → 2: $$|20 - 2| = 18$$ cylinders → $$18 \times 6 = 108$$ ms
  * 2 → 40: $$|2 - 40| = 38$$ cylinders → $$38 \times 6 = 228$$ ms
  * 40 → 6: $$|40 - 6| = 34$$ cylinders → $$34 \times 6 = 204$$ ms
  * 6 → 38: $$|6 - 38| = 32$$ cylinders → $$32 \times 6 = 192$$ ms
  * **Total Seek Time:** $$60 + 72 + 12 + 108 + 228 + 204 + 192 = 876$$ ms

    $$

    The average latency time is:

    $$
    \frac{0.025}{2} = 0.0125 \text{ seconds} = 12.5 \text{ ms}
    $$
* **Conclusion:** The average latency time is 12.5 ms, but the closest option is 2.5 s (assuming a typo in the question).

1. 0.1%
2. 1.0%
3. 2.5%
4. 0.01%

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. 0.01%

**Explanation:**

*   **Effective Access Time:** The effective access time (EAT) is given by:

    $$
    \text{EAT} = (1 - p) \times \text{Memory Access Time} + p \times \text{Page Fault Service Time}
    $$

    Here, the page fault service time is:

    $$
    0.4 \times 5\,\text{ms} + 0.6 \times 15\,\text{ms} = 2\,\text{ms} + 9\,\text{ms} = 11\,\text{ms}
    $$

    The EAT equation becomes:

    $$
    2\,\mu\text{s} = (1 - p) \times 1\,\mu\text{s} + p \times 11000\,\mu\text{s}
    $$

    Solving for $$p$$:

    $$
    2 = 1 - p + 11000p \implies 1 = 10999p \implies p \approx 0.00009 \approx 0.01\%
    $$
* **Conclusion:** The maximum acceptable page fault rate is approximately 0.01%.
