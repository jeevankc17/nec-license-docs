### 1. What is the difference between a primitive data type and an abstract data type in programming?

1. Primitive data types are basic and cannot be changed, while abstract data types can be modified.
2. Primitive data types are simple, while abstract data types are complex.
3. Primitive data types are defined by the programming language, while abstract data types are defined by the programmer.
4. Primitive data types are stored in memory, while abstract data types are stored on disk.

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. Primitive data types are defined by the programming language, while abstract data types are defined by the programmer.

**Explanation:**

* **Primitive Data Types:** These are the basic data types provided by the programming language itself, such as `int`, `float`, `char`, etc. They are predefined and cannot be broken down into simpler data types.
* **Abstract Data Types (ADTs):** These are data types that are defined by the programmer. They are more complex and can be composed of primitive data types or other ADTs. Examples include stacks, queues, and lists. ADTs are defined by their behavior (operations) rather than their implementation.
* **Conclusion:** The key difference is that primitive data types are built into the language, while ADTs are user-defined and can encapsulate both data and operations.

**Explanation:**

* **Big O Notation:** Big O notation is used to describe the time complexity of an algorithm, i.e., how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.
* $$O(1)$$**:** This represents constant time complexity, meaning the algorithm takes the same amount of time to execute regardless of the input size. For example, accessing an element in an array by index is an $$O(1)$$ operation.
* **Conclusion:** $$O(1)$$ indicates that the algorithm's runtime is constant and does not depend on the input size.

* **Bubble Sort:** Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
* **Time Complexity:** The worst-case time complexity of bubble sort is $$O(n^2)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of elements in the list. This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm may need to make $$n \times n$$ comparisons.
* **Conclusion:** Bubble sort is an example of an algorithm with quadratic time complexity, making it inefficient for large datasets.

  2. Repeatedly swapping the first (largest) element with the last element and reducing the heap size.
  3. Re-heapifying the remaining elements.
* **Conclusion:** Inserting elements into the heap is not a step in heap sort.

### 306. What is the space complexity of heap sort?

1. $$O(1)$$
2. $$O(\log n)$$
3. $$O(n)$$
4. $$O(n \log n)$$

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. $$O(1)$$

**Explanation:**

* **Heap Sort Space Complexity:** Heap sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional memory proportional to the input size. The space complexity is $$O(1)$$.
* **Conclusion:** The space complexity of heap sort is $$O(1)$$.

### 307. What is the minimum number of elements that can be sorted using heap sort?

1. 0
2. 1
3. 2
4. 3

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. 1

**Explanation:**

* **Heap Sort:** Heap sort can sort a single element, as it is already in the correct order.
* **Conclusion:** The minimum number of elements that can be sorted using heap sort is 1.

### 308. Which of the following is not a property of a heap?

1. It is a complete binary tree.
2. The root is always the maximum or minimum element.
3. The left child is always greater than the right child.
4. The height of the tree is $$\log(n)$$.

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. The left child is always greater than the right child.

**Explanation:**

* **Heap Properties:** A heap is a complete binary tree where the root is always the maximum (max-heap) or minimum (min-heap) element. However, there is no requirement that the left child must always be greater than the right child.
* **Conclusion:** The left child is not always greater than the right child in a heap.

### 309. What is the time complexity of building a heap?

1. $$O(n)$$
2. $$O(n \log n)$$
3. $$O(\log n)$$
4. $$O(n^2)$$

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. $$O(n)$$

**Explanation:**

* **Building a Heap:** The time complexity of building a heap from an unsorted array is $$O(n)$$.
* **Conclusion:** The time complexity of building a heap is $$O(n)$$.

</details>

### 310. Which of the following is not a type of heap?

1. Binary heap
2. Fibonacci heap
3. Ternary heap
4. Quad heap

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Quad heap

**Explanation:**

* **Types of Heaps:** Common types of heaps include binary heaps, Fibonacci heaps, and ternary heaps. Quad heap is not a standard type of heap.
* **Conclusion:** Quad heap is not a type of heap.

</details>

### 311. Which of the following is a disadvantage of heap sort?

1. It is not an in-place algorithm.
2. It cannot handle duplicate elements.
3. It has a worst-case time complexity of $$O(n^2)$$.
4. It is not stable.

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. It is not stable.

**Explanation:**

* **Heap Sort Disadvantages:** Heap sort is not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it does not preserve the relative order of equal elements.
* **Conclusion:** The main disadvantage of heap sort is that it is not stable.
