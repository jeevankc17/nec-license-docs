#### 51. What is a transaction in a database?

1. A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work
2. A single SQL query
3. A backup operation
4. A data compression operation

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work

**Explanation:**

* **Transaction:** A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work in a database. It ensures that either all operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none are.
* **ACID Properties:** Transactions follow the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure data integrity.
* **Single SQL Query:** While a single SQL query can be part of a transaction, a transaction typically consists of multiple queries.
* **Backup and Compression:** These are not related to transactions.
* **Conclusion:** A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.

#### 52. What is the purpose of the COMMIT statement in a database transaction?

1. To save the changes made during the transaction permanently
2. To undo the changes made during the transaction
3. To start a new transaction
4. To compress the database

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. To save the changes made during the transaction permanently

**Explanation:**

* **COMMIT Statement:** The COMMIT statement is used to save the changes made during the transaction permanently. Once a transaction is committed, the changes are written to the database and cannot be rolled back.
* **Permanent Changes:** After a COMMIT, the changes are durable and will persist even if the system crashes.
* **Undo Changes:** The ROLLBACK statement is used to undo changes, not COMMIT.
* **Start New Transaction:** The BEGIN or START TRANSACTION statement is used to start a new transaction.
* **Compression:** COMMIT has no relation to database compression.
* **Conclusion:** The purpose of the COMMIT statement is to save the changes made during the transaction permanently.

</details>

#### 53. What is the purpose of the ROLLBACK statement in a database transaction?

1. To undo the changes made during the transaction
2. To save the changes made during the transaction permanently
3. To start a new transaction
4. To compress the database

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. To undo the changes made during the transaction

**Explanation:**

* **ROLLBACK Statement:** The ROLLBACK statement is used to undo the changes made during the transaction. It reverts the database to its state before the transaction began.
* **Undo Changes:** If an error occurs during the transaction, ROLLBACK can be used to ensure that no partial changes are saved.
* **Save Changes:** The COMMIT statement is used to save changes, not ROLLBACK.
* **Start New Transaction:** The BEGIN or START TRANSACTION statement is used to start a new transaction.
* **Compression:** ROLLBACK has no relation to database compression.
* **Conclusion:** The purpose of the ROLLBACK statement is to undo the changes made during the transaction.

#### 54. What is a deadlock in a database?

1. A situation where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for one another to release locks on resources
2. A situation where a transaction is waiting for a resource that is never released
3. A situation where a transaction is aborted due to an error
4. A situation where the database is compressed

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. A situation where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for one another to release locks on resources

**Explanation:**

* **Deadlock:** A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for one another to release locks on resources. Each transaction holds a lock that the other transaction needs, creating a cycle of waiting.
* **Indefinite Wait:** Deadlocks can cause transactions to hang indefinitely, leading to system performance issues.
* **Resource Wait:** While waiting for a resource is part of a deadlock, the key aspect is the cyclic dependency between transactions.
* **Transaction Abort:** Deadlocks are often resolved by aborting one of the transactions, but this is not the definition of a deadlock.
* **Compression:** Deadlocks are unrelated to database compression.
* **Conclusion:** A deadlock is a situation where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for one another to release locks on resources.

</details>

#### 55. What is the purpose of the SAVEPOINT statement in a database transaction?

2. To save the changes made during the transaction permanently
3. To start a new transaction
4. To compress the database

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. To set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back

**Explanation:**

* **SAVEPOINT Statement:** The SAVEPOINT statement is used to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back. It allows partial rollback of a transaction.
* **Partial Rollback:** If an error occurs after a SAVEPOINT, you can roll back to that point without undoing the entire transaction.
* **Save Changes:** The COMMIT statement is used to save changes, not SAVEPOINT.
* **Start New Transaction:** The BEGIN or START TRANSACTION statement is used to start a new transaction.
* **Compression:** SAVEPOINT has no relation to database compression.
* **Conclusion:** The purpose of the SAVEPOINT statement is to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.

1. A virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query
2. A physical table that stores data
3. A backup of a table
4. A compressed version of a table

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. A virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query

**Explanation:**

* **Virtual Table:** Views are not physical tables; they are dynamically generated based on the underlying tables.
* **Physical Table:** A physical table stores data, but a view does not.
* **Backup and Compression:** Views are not related to backups or compression.
* **Conclusion:** A view is a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query.

1. A precompiled collection of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit
2. A backup of the database
3. A compressed version of the database
4. A virtual table based on a SQL query

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. To give specific privileges to a user or role

**Explanation:**

* **GRANT Statement:** The GRANT statement is used to give specific privileges to a user or role. It allows you to control access to database objects such as tables, views, and procedures.
* **Privileges:** For example, if you want to give a user the ability to SELECT data from a table, you would use GRANT SELECT ON table TO user.
* **Sorting:** The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set, not GRANT.
* **Filtering:** The WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on a condition, but GRANT is used to give privileges.
* **Joining Tables:** The JOIN clause is used to join two or more tables, not GRANT.
* **Conclusion:** The purpose of the GRANT statement is to give specific privileges to a user or role.
