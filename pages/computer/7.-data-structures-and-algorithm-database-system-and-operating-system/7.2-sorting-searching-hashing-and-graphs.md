# 7.2 Sorting, Searching, Hashing and Graphs

Sorting and searching are fundamental operations in computer science, widely used for data organization and retrieval. Graphs are essential structures in many applications like networks, social media, and routing algorithms. Understanding these concepts is vital for efficient problem-solving.

### 1.  Sorting techniques

Sorting is used to manipulate or order data structures, such as **arrays**, **linked lists**, or other data structures. The role of sorting is to organize the data in a way that makes searching, accessing, or processing it more efficient or easier.

**Types of Sorting:**

**Internal Sorting**: Involves sorting data that can all fit into the computer's main memory (RAM).\
&#xNAN;_&#x45;xample_: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.

**External Sorting**: Used when the data to be sorted is too large to fit into memory and needs to be stored externally (like in disk files).\
&#xNAN;_&#x45;xample_: Merge Sort used in external sorting.

#### Common Sorting Algorithms

**1. Insertion Sort:**

**Description:** Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position.

**Example:** Array:&#x20;

**Array:** \[5, 2, 9, 1]

**Steps:**

1. Start with the second element (2):
   * Compare 2 with 5. Since 2 is smaller than 5, move 5 one position to the right and insert 2 at the first position.
   * Array after the first step: \[2, 5, 9, 1]
2. Move to the third element (9):
   * Compare 9 with 5. Since 9 is greater, it stays in its place.
   * Array remains: \[2, 5, 9, 1]
3. Move to the fourth element (1):
   * Compare 1 with 9. Since 1 is smaller, shift 9 one position to the right.
   * Compare 1 with 5. Since 1 is smaller, shift 5 one position to the right.
   * Compare 1 with 2. Since 1 is smaller, shift 2 one position to the right.
   * Insert 1 at the first position.
   * Array after the final step: \[1, 2, 5, 9]

**Final Sorted Array:** \[1, 2, 5, 9]

* **Best Case:** O(n) (When the array is already sorted)
  * In the best case, each new element is greater than or equal to the last element, so only one comparison per element is made, resulting in a linear time complexity.
* **Worst Case:** O(n²) (When the array is sorted in reverse order)
  * In the worst case, each new element has to be compared with every element before it, leading to a quadratic time complexity.

***

**2. Selection Sort:**

**Description:** Repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

**Example:** Array: \[5, 2, 9, 1]

Steps:

* Select 1 (smallest), swap with 5: \[1, 2, 9, 5]
* Select 2 (smallest), no change: \[1, 2, 9, 5]
* Select 5, swap with 9: \[1, 2, 5, 9]

Final Sorted Array: \[1, 2, 5, 9]

* **Best Case:** O(n²) (No improvement for already sorted arrays)
  * Regardless of whether the array is sorted or not, Selection Sort always compares every element with all the others, resulting in a quadratic time complexity in all cases.
* **Worst Case:** O(n²) (Worst case remains the same as the best case)
  * Even in the worst case, it performs the same number of comparisons and swaps.

***

**3. Merge Sort:**

**Description:** Divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and merges them back together.

* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)

**Example:** Array: \[5, 2, 9, 1]

Steps:

* Divide: \[5, 2] and \[9, 1]
* Sort: \[2, 5] and \[1, 9]
* Merge: \[1, 2, 5, 9]

Final Sorted Array: \[1, 2, 5, 9]

* **Best Case:** O(n log n) (Regardless of the initial order of the array)
  * Merge Sort always divides the array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and merges them back together. The time complexity remains O(n log n) even if the array is already sorted.
* **Worst Case:** O(n log n) (Same as the best case)
  * The time complexity is still O(n log n) because the algorithm always splits the array and performs a merge step regardless of the input.

***

**4. Radix Sort:**

**Description:** Sorts numbers digit by digit from the least significant digit to the most significant.

* **Time Complexity:** O(nk) (n = number of elements, k = number of digits)

**Example:** Array: \[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]

Steps:

* Sort by least significant digit: \[170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]
* Sort by second least significant digit: \[802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90]
* Sort by third digit: \[2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]

Final Sorted Array: \[2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]

* **Best Case:** O(nk) (When the number of digits k is small)
  * The best case occurs when the number of digits for the numbers being sorted is small, resulting in a linear time complexity based on the number of elements (n).
* **Worst Case:** O(nk) (When the number of digits k is large)
  * Radix Sort's time complexity depends on both the number of elements (n) and the number of digits (k). The worst case happens when k is large, but it still remains linear in terms of the number of elements.

***

**5. Heap Sort:**

**Description:** Uses a binary heap (priority queue) to sort the array.

**Example:** Array: \[5, 2, 9, 1]

Steps:

1. **Build a max-heap** from the array.
2. **Swap the root** (maximum element) with the last element.
3. **Heapify** the remaining heap to restore the heap property.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all elements are sorted.

#### **Visual of Each Step:**

1. **Initial Array:** \[5, 2, 9, 1]
   * Max-Heap: \[9, 2, 5, 1]
2. **Swap root with last element:**
   * After swap: \[1, 2, 5, 9]
   * Heapify: \[5, 2, 1]
3. **Swap root with last element:**
   * After swap: \[1, 2, 5]
   * Heapify: \[2, 1, 5]
4. **Final Swap and Heapify:**
   * After swap: \[1, 2, 5]
   * Heapify: \[1, 2, 5]

Final Sorted Array: \[1, 2, 5, 9]

* **Best Case:** O(n log n) (Heapification is the same regardless of the order of the array)
  * **Heapify** after each swap has a complexity of **O(log n)**, and we perform this operation for each element in the heap. This step takes **O(n log n)** time in total.
* **Worst Case:** O(n log n) (Same as the best case)
  * The time complexity remains O(n log n) for both best and worst cases, as the algorithm always performs a series of heap operations.

### 2. Searching Techniques

**1. Sequential Search**

* **Description**:\
  Sequential search (also known as linear search) is the simplest search technique. It involves checking each element of the list one by one, from the beginning to the end, until the target element is found or the list is exhausted.
*   **Example**:\
    If you are looking for a specific number in an unsorted list of integers, you would start from the first element and check each subsequent element until the target number is found.

    **Example**:\
    List: `[4, 10, 15, 23, 42]`\
    Target: `15`\
    You start from `4`, then `10`, and finally find `15`.
* **Applications**:
  * Searching in small, unsorted datasets.
  * Searching for an item in an array or list where there are no specific ordering requirements.
* **Time Complexity**:\
  O(n) — The time complexity is linear because, in the worst case, you might need to check every element of the list (where `n` is the number of elements).

***

**2. Binary Search**

* **Description**:\
  Binary search is a much more efficient search algorithm that works only on **sorted arrays or lists**. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half. After each division, it checks whether the target is less than, greater than, or equal to the middle element, effectively halving the search space in each step.
* **Example**:\
  If you want to search for `15` in the sorted array `[4, 10, 15, 23, 42]`, the binary search would:
  * Compare `15` with the middle element, `15`.
  * Since the middle element is the target, the search stops.
* **Applications**:
  * Searching in large datasets or databases where the list is already sorted.
  * Used in **binary search trees (BST)** for fast lookups.
* **Time Complexity**:\
  O(log n) — The time complexity is logarithmic because the size of the search space is halved in each step, resulting in fewer steps to find the target element.

***

**3. Tree Search**

* **Description**:\
  Tree search refers to searching in a **tree structure**, like a **binary search tree (BST)** or other types of trees. In this method, you start at the root and traverse through the tree nodes based on comparisons with the target value. At each node, the search proceeds to the left or right child depending on whether the target value is smaller or larger than the current node’s value.
*   **Example**:\
    If you are searching for `15` in the following binary search tree:

    ```markdown
        20
       /  \
     10    30
      \      \
      15     40
    ```

    * Start at the root, `20`. Since `15` is smaller, move to the left child (`10`).
    * Compare `15` with `10`, and since `15` is larger, move to the right child (`15`), which is the target.
* **Applications**:
  * **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
  * **Database indexing** and search operations (e.g., B-trees, AVL trees).
  * **Game AI** in decision trees or move search.
* **Time Complexity**:
  * **O(log n)** for balanced trees (e.g., AVL or Red-Black trees), as the tree height is logarithmic relative to the number of elements.
  * **O(n)** in the worst case for unbalanced trees, as the tree might degenerate into a linked list.

***

### 3. Hashing Techniques

Hashing is a technique used to quickly locate a data record given its search key. It involves using a hash function to map data to a fixed-size value called a hash code, and storing this hash code in a hash table.

***

**1. Hash Function**

* **Description**:\
  A **hash function** is a function that takes an input (or "key") and returns a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a hash code. The hash code is used to uniquely identify the data or key, and it's used to index the data in a hash table.
* **Example**:\
  If you want to store a person's name in a hash table, the hash function might take their name (e.g., "Alice") and convert it into a hash code like `9876534`, which will be used as an index to store or retrieve the data from the hash table.
* **Applications**:
  * **Data retrieval**: Efficiently finding data based on a unique key (e.g., looking up a phone number by a name).
  * **Hash-based data structures** like hash tables, hash maps, and dictionaries.
  * **Cryptographic functions** (e.g., in digital signatures or blockchain systems).

***

**2. Hash Tables**

* **Description**:\
  A **hash table** (or hash map) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index (or hash code) into an array of slots, from which the desired value can be found. The main advantage of hash tables is that they provide fast insertion, deletion, and search operations, ideally with O(1) time complexity.
* **Example**:\
  In a phonebook application, the name of the person (e.g., "Alice") could be the key, and the corresponding phone number (e.g., "555-1234") would be the value. A hash table could store this pair in an index location derived from the hash code of the name "Alice". This allows quick look-up when you search for the phone number by name.
* **Applications**:
  * **Dictionaries and hash maps** in programming languages (e.g., Python's `dict` or Java's `HashMap`).
  * **Database indexing**: Storing and retrieving data in an indexed form.
  * **Caching**: Storing results of expensive function calls for quick retrieval.
* **Time Complexity**:
  * **O(1)** for average cases (insertion, deletion, and search).
  * **O(n)** in the worst case (if all keys hash to the same value, causing a collision).

***

**3. Collision Resolution Techniques**

A **collision** occurs when two different keys hash to the same index. Collisions need to be resolved to ensure that both keys can be stored and retrieved correctly.

**A. Chaining**

* **Description**:\
  In **chaining**, each slot in the hash table contains a linked list (or another data structure) that holds all the keys that hash to the same index. When a collision occurs, the new key is simply added to the linked list at the corresponding slot.
*   **Example**:\
    Let's assume you have a hash table of size 5 and a hash function that returns the following hash values for keys:

    * Key "Alice" -> Hash code: 1
    * Key "Bob" -> Hash code: 1
    * Key "Charlie" -> Hash code: 3

    Since both "Alice" and "Bob" hash to index `1`, they are stored in a linked list at that index, like this:

    ```csharp
    Hash Table:
    [0] -> null
    [1] -> Alice -> Bob
    [2] -> null
    [3] -> Charlie
    [4] -> null
    ```
* **Applications**:
  * Useful when the hash table has a low load factor (few collisions).
  * Used in most basic implementations of hash tables.
* **Time Complexity**:
  * **Average case**: O(1) for search, insertion, and deletion (assuming a good hash function and low collision rate).
  * **Worst case**: O(n) for search, insertion, and deletion (when all keys hash to the same value).

**B. Open Addressing**

* **Description**:\
  **Open addressing** resolves collisions by probing (or searching) for the next available slot in the table. When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for another empty slot in the hash table and inserts the key there. Several probing methods exist, such as **linear probing**, **quadratic probing**, and **double hashing**.
  * **Linear Probing**: When a collision occurs at index `i`, the algorithm checks the next slot (`i+1`), and so on, until an empty slot is found.
  * **Quadratic Probing**: It checks slots at `i+1²`, `i+2²`, and so on, reducing clustering.
  * **Double Hashing**: A second hash function is used to calculate the next probe index.
*   **Example**:\
    If the hash table size is 5, and the hash function for the key "Alice" produces index `1`, and the key "Bob" also hashes to index `1`, linear probing will attempt the next slot (`2`), and store Bob there.

    ```csharp
    Hash Table with Linear Probing:
    [0] -> null
    [1] -> Alice
    [2] -> Bob
    [3] -> null
    [4] -> null
    ```
* **Applications**:
  * Suitable for hash tables with a high load factor.
  * Used in environments where the hash table size is fixed, and resizing is not feasible.
* **Time Complexity**:
  * **Average case**: O(1) for search, insertion, and deletion (with low load factor).
  *
