2. 45 degrees
3. 90 degrees
4. Either 90 or 180 degrees

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. 90 degrees

**Explanation:**

* In **offset sections**, the bends in the cutting plane are all **90 degrees**.
* This allows the cutting plane to pass through different features of the object while maintaining a straight path.
* 270 degrees, 45 degrees, and 180 degrees are not used for offset sections.

* This type of section is ideal for focusing on specific features without showing the entire object.
* Half section, Full section, and Revolved section are not used for this purpose.

</details>

#### 116. One quarter of the object is removed in \_\_\_\_\_\_.
