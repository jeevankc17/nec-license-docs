# 1.3 Alternating Current Fundamentals

### 1. **Principle of Alternating Voltage and Current Generation, Equations, and Waveforms**

* **Alternating Current (AC)**: It is an electric current that reverses its direction periodically, as opposed to direct current (DC), where the flow of electric charge is in one direction only.
* **Generation of AC**: AC is typically generated using **alternators** or **synchronous generators**, where mechanical energy (e.g., from a turbine) is converted into electrical energy. The most common method of generation is through electromagnetic induction, where a conductor moves through a magnetic field.
* **AC Waveforms**: The most basic waveform for AC is a **sine wave**, which represents a smooth, periodic oscillation. A typical AC waveform is defined by the following parameters:
  * **Peak Value (Maximum Value)**: The highest value of the waveform (voltage or current).
  * **RMS (Root Mean Square) Value**: The effective value of the waveform. For a sinusoidal AC, the RMS value is the peak value divided by âˆš2.
  * **Average Value**: The average of all instantaneous values in one complete cycle, often zero for symmetric sinusoidal waveforms.

**Equation for a sinusoidal AC waveform**:

$$
v(t) = V_{\text{max}} \sin(\omega t + \phi)
$$

Where:

$$
v(t) = \text{instantaneous voltage}, \\
V_{\text{max}} = \text{peak voltage}, \\
\omega = \text{angular frequency} \quad (\omega = 2\pi f, \text{where } f \text{ is the frequency}), \\
t = \text{time}, \\
\phi = \text{phase angle}
$$

### **2. Average, Peak, and RMS Values**

1. **Peak Value**:
   * The **peak value** (also known as the **maximum value**) is the highest point reached by the voltage or current in one cycle.
   * For a sinusoidal AC, the peak value is denoted as $$( V_{\text{peak}} )$$or $$( I_{\text{peak}} )$$.
2. **RMS (Root Mean Square) Value**:
   * The RMS value is a measure of the effective value of an AC waveform. It is the equivalent DC value that would produce the same power dissipation in a resistive load.
   *   For a sinusoidal waveform:

       $$
       V_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{V_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}}
       $$
   * This means that the RMS value is approximately 0.707 times the peak value for a sinusoidal waveform.
3. **Average Value**:
   *   The **average value** is the arithmetic mean of the values of the waveform over one complete cycle. For a pure sinusoidal waveform, the average value is zero (due to the symmetrical nature of the waveform). However, the **average absolute value** (or the rectified average value) is often used:

       $$
       V_{\text{avg}} = \frac{2}{\pi} V_{\text{peak}} \approx 0.637 \times V_{\text{peak}}
       $$
   * For half-wave rectified signals, the average value is non-zero.

### 3. **Three-Phase Systems**

* **Three-Phase Power**: This is a method used to generate and distribute alternating current. In a three-phase system, three conductors carry three sinusoidal voltages or currents that are **out of phase** with each other by $$( 120^\circ )$$. It is the most common method for industrial and commercial power distribution.
* **Advantages of Three-Phase Systems**:
  * **Constant Power**: In a three-phase system, the power delivered is more constant compared to a single-phase system, which results in smoother operation of motors.
  * **More Efficient**: Three-phase systems are more efficient for transmitting electrical power over long distances.
  * **Smaller Conductors**: For the same amount of power, a three-phase system requires less conductor material than a single-phase system.

**Equations for Three-Phase Systems**:

For **line-to-line voltage**:

$$
V_L = \sqrt{3} V_{\text{phase}} \quad \text{(line-to-line voltage)}
$$

Where:

$$
V_L = \text{line-to-line voltage} \\
V_{\text{phase}} = \text{phase voltage (voltage across each phase)}
$$



For **power in three-phase systems**:

* **Balanced Load Power**:

$$
P = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L \cos(\theta) \quad \text{(Balanced Load Power)}
$$

Where:

$$
P = \text{total power} \\
V_L = \text{line-to-line voltage} \\
I_L = \text{line current} \\
\theta = \text{phase angle between voltage and current}
$$



* **Total Apparent Power**:

$$
S = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L \quad \text{(Total Apparent Power)}
$$

* **Reactive Power**:

$$
Q = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L \sin(\theta) \quad \text{(Reactive Power)}
$$

The key point is that in a balanced three-phase system, the sum of the instantaneous powers in all three phases is constant.

### Conclusion

* AC is an electrical current that reverses direction periodically, generated through electromagnetic induction.
* Key AC parameters: peak value, RMS value (effective value), and average value.
* Three-phase systems provide more constant and efficient power, requiring less conductor material compared to single-phase systems.
