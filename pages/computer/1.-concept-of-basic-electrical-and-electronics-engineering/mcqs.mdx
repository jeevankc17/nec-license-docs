### 1. Resistance of a wire is yΩ. The wire is stretched to triple its length, then the resistance becomes\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. y/3
2. 3y
3. 6y
4. y/6

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. 3y

**Explanation:**

* Resistance of a wire is given by:\
  $$R = \rho \frac{L}{A}$$\
  where:
  * $$ho$$ = resistivity of the material,
  * $$L$$ = length of the wire,
  * $$A$$ = cross-sectional area of the wire.
* When the wire is stretched to triple its length, the new length $$L' = 3L$$.
* Volume remains constant, so:\
  $$A' = \frac{A}{3}$$
* New resistance:\
  $$R' = \rho \frac{3L}{A/3} = 9 \rho \frac{L}{A} = 9R$$
* Therefore, the resistance becomes **3y**.
