### 1. Hexadecimal can express in one digit what is done by following binary number of binary digits:

1. $$\text{One}$$
2. $$\text{Four}$$
3. $$\text{Two}$$
4. $$\text{Eight}$$

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

* This is because $$2^4 = 16$$, so one hexadecimal digit can represent 16 unique values, equivalent to 4 binary digits.

</details>

### 2. NAND gates are preferred over others because these have:

1. $$\text{Have lower fabrication area}$$
2. $$\text{Can be used to make any gate}$$
3. $$\text{Consume less electronic power}$$
4. $$\text{Provide maximum density in a chip}$$

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. $$\text{Can be used to make any gate}$$

**Explanation:**

* NAND gates are **universal gates**, meaning they can be used to construct any other logic gate (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
* This flexibility makes them highly preferred in digital circuit design.
* For example:
  * A NOT gate can be made using a NAND gate by connecting both inputs together.
