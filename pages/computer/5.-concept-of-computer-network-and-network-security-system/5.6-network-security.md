# 5.6 Network Security

Network security is crucial for protecting data and systems from unauthorized access, misuse, or damage. It involves various technologies, protocols, and practices designed to protect networks and their components.

In this section, we will cover key topics related to **Network Security**:

***

### **1. Types of Computer Security**

* **Confidentiality**:
  * Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users and protected from unauthorized access.
  * **Encryption** is commonly used to ensure confidentiality.
* **Integrity**:
  * Ensures that data is accurate and has not been tampered with during transmission.
  * **Hashing** algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA) are used to verify data integrity.
* **Availability**:
  * Ensures that authorized users can access the information and systems when needed, without delays.
  * Protection against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is critical for maintaining availability.
* **Authentication**:
  * Ensures that the user or system requesting access is who they claim to be.
  * Techniques include **passwords**, **biometrics**, and **public key infrastructure (PKI)**.
* **Non-repudiation**:
  * Ensures that the sender of a message cannot deny having sent the message.
  * **Digital signatures** are used to ensure non-repudiation.

***

### **2. Types of Security Attacks**

* **Passive Attacks**:
  * **Eavesdropping** or **Sniffing**: Unauthorized interception and monitoring of data transmission.
  * The goal is to gather information without affecting the system’s performance.
* **Active Attacks**:
  * **Modification of Data**: Attacker alters or injects data during transmission (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle attack).
  * **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Attackers attempt to make a service or system unavailable to users.
  * **Replay Attacks**: Attacker intercepts and retransmits legitimate data to impersonate the sender.
* **Insider Attacks**:
  * Attacks originating from within the organization, often by trusted individuals with access to the system.
* **Spoofing**:
  * Faking identity to gain unauthorized access or perform actions under the guise of a legitimate user or device.
* **Phishing**:
  * Social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information, typically through fake emails or websites.

***

### **3. Principles of Cryptography**

Cryptography is the science of encoding and decoding information to keep it secure from unauthorized access. It relies on several principles:

* **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that only authorized parties can access sensitive data.
* **Integrity**: Ensuring that the data is not altered in an unauthorized way during storage or transmission.
* **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the parties involved in communication.
* **Non-repudiation**: Ensuring that a sender cannot deny sending a message, or a receiver cannot deny receiving it.
* **Key Management**: Ensuring the secure generation, distribution, and storage of cryptographic keys.

Cryptographic methods include:

* **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
* **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**: Different keys are used for encryption and decryption (e.g., RSA).
* **Hash Functions**: Converts data into a fixed-length hash (e.g., SHA-256) for data integrity verification.

### 4. RSA Algorithm

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm. It is based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

**Steps of RSA:**

**Key Generation:**

1. Select two large prime numbers $$p$$ and $$q$$.
2. Compute $$n = p \times q$$, and $$\phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)$$.
3. Choose a public exponent $$e$$ such that $$1 < e < \phi(n)$$ and $$e$$ is coprime with $$\phi(n)$$.
4. Compute the private key $$d$$ such that $$e \times d \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ \phi(n))$$.

**Encryption:**

* The public key $$(e, n)$$ is used to encrypt the plaintext $$M$$ into ciphertext $$C$$:\
  $$C = M^e \ (\text{mod} \ n)$$

**Decryption:**

* The private key $$(d, n)$$ is used to decrypt the ciphertext $$C$$ back into the plaintext $$M$$:\
  $$M = C^d \ (\text{mod} \ n)$$

***

**Applications:**

RSA is widely used for securing data transmission over the internet, particularly in protocols like **HTTPS**.

***

### **5. Digital Signatures**

A **Digital Signature** is a cryptographic method used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document.

* A digital signature uses **asymmetric encryption**: the sender encrypts the message hash with their private key, and the recipient decrypts it using the sender's public key.
* If the decrypted hash matches the hash of the received message, it confirms that the message is authentic and has not been altered.

**Steps**:

1. **Sender**: Generates a message hash and encrypts it with their private key to create the signature.
2. **Receiver**: Decrypts the signature using the sender's public key and compares the resulting hash with the hash of the received message.

***

### **6. Securing E-mail (PGP)**

**PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)** is an encryption program used for securing email communication. It provides:

* **Confidentiality**: By encrypting the email using the recipient's public key.
* **Authentication**: By digitally signing the email with the sender's private key.
* **Integrity**: Ensures the email hasn’t been altered during transmission.

PGP uses a combination of:

* **Asymmetric Encryption**: To encrypt the symmetric encryption key (using public/private keys).
* **Symmetric Encryption**: To encrypt the actual message using a shared secret key.

PGP is widely used for email encryption and file encryption.

***

### **7. Securing TCP Connections (SSL/TLS)**

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and its successor **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** are protocols used to establish secure connections between a client and a server over a network.

* **SSL/TLS** ensures that the communication between two devices is **encrypted** and **authenticated**.
* **SSL/TLS Handshake**: A process where the client and server agree on encryption algorithms, exchange keys, and verify identities.

**Steps of SSL/TLS**:

1. **Handshake**:
   * Client and server exchange messages to authenticate each other and negotiate encryption algorithms.
2. **Session Key Generation**:
   * The client and server agree on a shared session key used to encrypt the data.
3. **Data Transmission**:
   * Data is encrypted with the session key and transmitted securely.
4. **Session Termination**:
   * The session is closed securely when the communication ends.

SSL/TLS is commonly used to secure **HTTPS** connections.

***

### **8. Network Layer Security (IPsec, VPN)**

* **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**:
  * IPsec is a suite of protocols used to secure Internet Protocol (IP) communications.
  * It provides encryption, authentication, and data integrity at the **network layer**.
  * **Modes of Operation**: **Transport Mode** (only encrypts the payload) and **Tunnel Mode** (encrypts the entire packet).
* **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**:
  * A VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection over a public network, allowing users to securely access a private network.
  * **VPN Types**:
    * **Remote Access VPN**: Connects individual users to a network.
    * **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connects entire networks, typically used by organizations.

IPsec is commonly used in VPN implementations.

***

### **9. Securing Wireless LANs (WEP, WPA)**

* **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**:
  * WEP is an outdated security protocol used to secure wireless networks.
  * It uses **RC4 encryption** but is considered insecure due to weaknesses in the encryption process and key management.
* **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**:
  * WPA improves upon WEP by offering stronger encryption using **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard).
  * **WPA2** is the most secure version of WPA and is widely used in wireless networks.

***

### **10. Firewalls**

A **Firewall** is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

* **Types of Firewalls**:
  * **Packet Filtering Firewall**: Inspects packets and blocks those that don’t meet predefined security criteria.
  * **Stateful Inspection Firewall**: Tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the state of the traffic.
  * **Proxy Firewall**: Acts as an intermediary between the client and server, masking the client's identity.
* **Firewall Rules**:
  * Firewalls use **access control lists (ACLs)** to define rules for allowing or blocking traffic.
  * Rules are based on factors like **IP addresses**, **port numbers**, and **protocols**.
