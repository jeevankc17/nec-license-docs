#### 305. Phong Shading is also called...

1. Flat shading
2. Normal vector interpolation shading
3. Constant intensity shading
4. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. Normal vector interpolation shading

**Explanation:**

* **Step 1:** Phong shading interpolates normal vectors across a surface.
* **Step 2:** This results in smoother shading compared to flat shading.
* **Conclusion:** It is also known as normal vector interpolation shading.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. Intensity interpolation method

**Explanation:**

* **Step 1:** Gouraud shading interpolates intensities across a surface.
* **Step 2:** This results in smoother transitions between colors.
* **Conclusion:** It is also known as intensity interpolation shading.

</details>

#### 307. Which one of the following calculations is/ are performed on the Gouraud Shading?

1. Determining the average unit normal vector at each polygon vertex
2. Apply an illumination model to each vertex to calculate the vertex intensity
3. Linearly interpolate the vertex intensities
4. All of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. All of the above

**Explanation:**

* **Step 1:** Gouraud shading involves:
  * Calculating average normal vectors at vertices.
  * Applying an illumination model to calculate vertex intensities.
  * Interpolating intensities across the polygon.
* **Conclusion:** All steps are part of the Gouraud shading process.

#### 308. The phenomenon of having a continuous glow of a beam on the screen even after it is removed is called as

1. Fluorescence
2. Phosphorescence
3. Persistence
4. Incandescence

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. Phosphorescence

**Explanation:**

* **Step 1:** Phosphorescence is the phenomenon where a material continues to glow after the excitation source is removed.
* **Step 2:** This is due to the slow release of stored energy.
* **Conclusion:** It is commonly observed in CRT screens.

</details>

#### 309. The best hidden surface removal methods used for complex scenes with more than a few thousand surfaces is/are

1. Depth sorting method
2. Octree method

#### 310. The anti-aliasing technique which allows shift of 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 of a pixel diameter enabling a closer path of a line is

1. Pixel phasing
2. Intensity compensation
3. Filtering
4. Sampling technique

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Pixel phasing

**Explanation:**

* **Step 1:** Pixel phasing shifts pixel positions by fractions of a pixel diameter.
* **Step 2:** This reduces jagged edges and improves line smoothness.
* **Conclusion:** It is a common anti-aliasing technique.
