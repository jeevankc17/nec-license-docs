# 6.4 Introduction to Computer Graphics

**Computer graphics** is the field of computer science that focuses on generating, manipulating, and displaying visual images using computers. It combines elements of mathematics, physics, and art to create visual representations of data, virtual environments, and multimedia content. This section covers the basics of computer graphics, graphics hardware, software, and input/output devices.

### **1. Overview of Computer Graphics**

Computer graphics can be divided into two primary categories:

* **2D Graphics**: Representations of objects in two dimensions, such as images and drawings.
* **3D Graphics**: Representations of objects in three-dimensional space, often used in gaming, simulations, and design.

Graphics are essential in various applications, including:

* **Entertainment**: Movies, video games, and simulations.
* **Engineering**: CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and 3D modeling.
* **Scientific Visualization**: Displaying complex data and simulations.
* **Web Design and User Interfaces**: Visual design of websites and apps.

The process of creating graphics involves both **rendering** (creating the image from models) and **displaying** (outputting the image on a screen or print).

### **2. Graphics Hardware**

The hardware used in computer graphics plays a crucial role in generating and displaying images efficiently. It includes various display technologies, devices, and processors.

1. **Display Technology**

Displays are devices used to visually present information generated by a computer. There are two main types of display technologies used in computer graphics:

* **Raster-Scan Displays**: These displays use a grid of pixels to represent the image. The screen is refreshed by scanning the grid line-by-line (raster scan). Common examples include monitors and televisions.
  * Each pixel has its color and intensity, and the entire screen is refreshed rapidly to create an image.
* **Vector Displays**: Unlike raster displays, vector displays create images by directly drawing lines between points on the screen. They are less common today but were widely used in early computer graphics for drawing simple shapes.
  * Vector displays have higher clarity for lines but are limited to drawing lines and geometric shapes.

2. **Architecture of Raster-Scan Displays**

Raster-scan displays use a **cathode ray tube (CRT)** or **LCD screen** to display images by scanning the entire screen in a raster pattern. The basic process includes:

* The electron gun or liquid crystals scan across the screen in a series of horizontal lines (scan lines).
* Each line is divided into **pixels** (picture elements), which are the smallest addressable units of the screen.
* The image is drawn by changing the color and intensity of individual pixels as the scan progresses.

3. **Display Processors**

**Display processors** are dedicated hardware components responsible for controlling the rendering of images to the screen. These processors work with the **framebuffer**, which is a memory area that holds the image data to be displayed. They can perform operations like:

* Pixel manipulation (color, brightness, etc.)
* Handling resolution changes
* Interfacing with the graphics card

Graphics processors (GPUs) are specialized for high-speed rendering and computation tasks involved in 3D graphics, image processing, and video acceleration.

4. **Output Devices**

* **Monitors/Displays**: These devices show the visual output of computer systems. They can be CRT, LCD, LED, OLED, etc.
* **Printers**: Though primarily for static images, printers can produce graphics on paper, often used in technical design and documentation.
* **Projectors**: Used for large-scale displays, such as presentations, virtual reality, or collaborative workspaces.

5. **Input Devices**

Input devices allow users to interact with computer graphics systems, such as drawing, selecting, or manipulating graphical objects:

* **Mouse**: Used for pointing and selecting objects.
* **Keyboard**: Allows user input for commands and text.
* **Graphics Tablet**: A specialized device for precise drawing and design.
* **Trackball**: A pointing device used for manipulating graphics.
* **Touchscreen**: Allows direct interaction with graphical elements through touch.

### **3. Graphics Software and Software Standards**

Graphics software is essential for creating, manipulating, and displaying images and models. It can be categorized into:

* **Rendering Software**: Tools that generate images from 3D models (e.g., Blender, Maya).
* **CAD Software**: Used for technical drawings, architecture, and engineering (e.g., AutoCAD).
* **Image Editing Software**: Tools like Photoshop and GIMP for editing raster images.
* **Vector Graphics Software**: Tools like Adobe Illustrator for creating and editing vector-based images.

1. **Software Standards**

Software standards ensure compatibility and consistency across graphics systems. Key standards include:

* **OpenGL**: A widely-used, cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. It provides functions for drawing shapes, handling textures, and applying lighting effects.
* **DirectX**: A collection of APIs developed by Microsoft for multimedia applications, including graphics rendering.
* **Vulkan**: A low-level, high-performance API for graphics rendering, developed by the Khronos Group (the same group behind OpenGL).
* **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**: An XML-based vector graphics format used for web design and other applications that require resolution-independent images.
* **PDF (Portable Document Format)**: Supports vector-based images, making it useful for displaying graphical designs and technical drawings.
* **WebGL**: A web-based API for rendering interactive 3D graphics within a browser without the need for plugins.
