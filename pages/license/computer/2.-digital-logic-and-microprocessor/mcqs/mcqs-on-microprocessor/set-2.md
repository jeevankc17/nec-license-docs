<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. An open-loop control system does not use feedback to control the output, while a closed-loop control system uses feedback to control the output

**Explanation:**

* An open-loop control system does not use feedback to control the output, meaning it does not adjust its operation based on the output. A closed-loop control system uses feedback to monitor the output and adjust its operation to achieve the desired result, making it more accurate and reliable.

### 98. What is virtual memory in an operating system?

1. A feature that enables an operating system to run more applications than the available physical memory by temporarily transferring data to a hard disk
2. A feature that enables an operating system to run more applications than the available physical memory by temporarily transferring data to a cloud storage
3. A feature that enables an operating system to run more applications than the available physical memory by temporarily transferring data to a network storage

**Answer:** 1. A feature that enables an operating system to run more applications than the available physical memory by temporarily transferring data to a hard disk

**Explanation:**

* Virtual memory is a memory management technique that uses a combination of hardware and software to provide the illusion of a larger memory space than is physically available. It allows the system to use secondary storage (like a hard disk) as an extension of main memory, enabling the execution of programs that require more memory than is physically available.

### 99. What is the main goal of cache memory in a computer system?

1. To reduce the access time for frequently accessed data
2. To increase the access time for frequently accessed data
3. To provide a low-cost memory for storing large amounts of data
4. To provide a high-capacity memory for storing large amounts of data

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. To reduce the access time for frequently accessed data

**Explanation:**

* The main goal of cache memory is to reduce the access time for frequently accessed data by storing it in a small, fast memory that is closer to the CPU. This improves system performance by reducing the time needed to access data from the main memory.

### 100. What is the main function of a control unit in a computer system?

1. To control the flow of data and instructions in the computer system
2. To store and retrieve data from memory
3. To perform arithmetic and logical operations
4. To display output on a screen

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. To control the flow of data and instructions in the computer system

**Explanation:**

* The control unit (CU) is a part of the CPU that directs the operation of the processor. It controls the flow of data and instructions between the CPU and other components, such as memory and input/output devices, ensuring that the system operates correctly and efficiently.
