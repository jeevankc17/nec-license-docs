### 1. What types of machine learning tasks are speech recognition and movie rating prediction, respectively?

1. Classification and regression
2. Regression and classification
3. Clustering and regression
4. Classification and clustering

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**

1. Classification and regression

**Explanation:**\
Speech recognition is a classification task, where the model classifies audio signals into specific words or phrases. Movie rating prediction, on the other hand, is a regression task because it involves predicting a continuous value (the rating) based on input features.

### Question 2: In C++, what is the output of the following code snippet?

1. A
2. B
3. AB
4. no output

```c
class A {
public:
    virtual void display() {
        cout << "A";
    }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    void display() override {
        cout << "B";
    }
};

int main() {
    A* ptr = new B();
    ptr->display();
    delete ptr;
    return 0;
}
```

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**\
2\. B

**Explanation:**\
The pointer `ptr` is of type `A*` but points to an object of type `B`. Since `display()` is a virtual function, the overridden version in class `B` is called, and the output is "B".

1. 6A
2. 8A
3. 2A
4. 4A

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**

1. 6A

**Explanation:**\
The current through the 10 ohm resistor is given by $$\frac{v1}{10} = 2A$$.

Applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node 1:\
$$i5 = i10 + i2$$\
So, $$i2 = i5 - 2$$.

The voltage drop across the 2 ohm resistor is $$2 \times i2$$.

Given $$V1 = 20V$$, we have:\
$$v2 = 20 - (2 \times i2)$$ (since $$v2 = v$$ as in parallel).

From the equation $$v = 12V$$, we get:\
$$12 = 20 - (2 \times i2)$$, which simplifies to:\
$$i2 = 4A$$.

Therefore, the total current $$I = i5 = i2 + 2 = 6A$$.

### 4. Given the production rules: Rule 1: S -> aSb and S -> e Rule 2: R -> cRd and R -> e How many production rules start with different alphabets in S union R?

1. 6A
2. 8A
3. 2A
4. 4A

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**\
3\. 2A

**Explanation:**\
The production rules for S are:

* S -> aSb
* S -> e

The production rules for R are:

* R -> cRd
* R -> e

In total, there are two different starting alphabets: 'a' for S and 'c' for R. So, there are 2 production rules that start with different alphabets.

### 7. In the demand paging memory, a page table is held in registers. If it takes 1000 ms to service a page fault and if the memory access time is 10 ms, what is the effective access time for a page fault rate of 0.01?

1. 12.9 ms
2. 20.9 ms
3. 19.9 ms
4. 0.01 ms

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**\
3\. 19.9 ms

**Explanation:**\
The formula for effective access time is:\
$$\text{EAT} = (1 - \text{page fault rate}) \times \text{memory access time} + (\text{page fault rate}) \times (\text{page fault service time} + \text{memory access time})$$

Substituting the given values:\
$$\text{EAT} = (1 - 0.01) \times 10 + 0.01 \times (1000 + 10) = 9.9 + 10.1 = 19.9 \, \text{ms}$$.

### 8. A company purchases a piece of equipment for $10,000. The equipment has a useful life of 5 years with no salvage value at the end of its useful life. Calculate the annual depreciation percentage.

1. 9%
2. 15%
3. 10%
4. 20%

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**\
4\. 20%

**Explanation:**\
The annual depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, which is:\
$$\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost of Equipment} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}$$

Given the cost of the equipment is $10,000, the salvage value is $0, and the useful life is 5 years, the annual depreciation is:\
$$\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{10,000}{5} = 2,000$$

The depreciation percentage is calculated as:\
$$\text{Depreciation Percentage} = \frac{\text{Annual Depreciation}}{\text{Cost of Equipment}} \times 100$$\
$$\text{Depreciation Percentage} = \frac{2,000}{10,000} \times 100 = 20\%$$.

### 9. What does the C function call `fwrite(str, strlen(str) + 1, 1, filePointer)` do?

a) Prints all string characters including the null character\
b) Prints all string characters except the null character\
c) Writes the length of the string to the file\
d) Writes the string length plus one to the file

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**\
a) Prints all string characters including the null character

**Explanation:**\
The `fwrite` function in C writes the specified number of bytes from `str` to the file. By using `strlen(str) + 1`, the null terminator `\0` is included, so it writes the entire string, including the null character.

### 11. For a 4M-bit chip with 19 external connectors and 8-bit data lines, how many address lines are there?

a) 8\
b) 16\
c) 19\
d) 20

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**\
a) 8

**Explanation:**\
Chip organization: 4M-bit

* Total external connections: 19
* Data lines: 8
* A 4M-bit chip has $$2^{22}$$ bits (since 4M = 4 \* 1024 \* 1024 = $$2^{22}$$). The number of address lines required to access $$2^{22}$$ bits is 22.
* Out of the 19 external connections, 8 are data lines, leaving 11 for address lines and control signals.
* Since 8 data lines require 3 bits to represent $$2^3$$ = 8 possible values, subtracting 3 from the 11 remaining connections gives 8 address lines.

d) 23

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**\
a) 18

### 13. In a class B amplifier, what happens to voltage gain and impedance when capacitance is added to the emitter terminal?

a) Both voltage gain and impedance increase\
b) Voltage gain increases, impedance decreases\
c) Voltage gain decreases, impedance increases\
d) Both voltage gain and impedance decrease

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**\
a) Both voltage gain and impedance increase

**Explanation:**\
When capacitance is added to the emitter terminal of a class B amplifier, it reduces the bypass effect, which can increase both the voltage gain and the impedance.

### 14. In a tree traversal problem, which node is visited last in postorder when converting from preorder 30, 20, 10, 15, 25, 23, 39, 35, 42?

a) 10\
b) 15\
c) 23\
d) 30

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:**\
d) 30

**Explanation:**\
In postorder traversal, nodes are visited in the order: left subtree, right subtree, and then the root.

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt="" data-size="original">\
Given the preorder traversal `30, 20, 10, 15, 25, 23, 39, 35, 42`, the root node in this case is `30`. In postorder, we will visit all its descendants first, and the last node visited will be the root.\
Hence, the last node visited in postorder traversal is `30`.
