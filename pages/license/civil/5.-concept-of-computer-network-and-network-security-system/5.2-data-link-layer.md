# 5.2 Data Link Layer

The **Data Link Layer** is the second layer of the OSI model and plays a critical role in providing reliable communication between two devices on the same network. It ensures that data is properly formatted and free from errors before it is passed to the network layer. This layer handles **error detection**, **error correction**, and **flow control** to guarantee that the data transmitted between devices is correct and arrives in sequence. Additionally, it also deals with protocols that govern access to the shared medium, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi.

### **1. Services Provided by the Data Link Layer**

The Data Link Layer offers the following essential services:

1. **Framing**: Divides the stream of bits received from the Network Layer into manageable chunks known as **frames**. Each frame contains both data and control information, including a **header** (addressing and control) and a **trailer** (error detection/correction).
2. **Error Detection and Correction**: It ensures that data is received correctly and is free from errors.
3. **Flow Control**: Manages the rate of data transmission to prevent congestion and buffer overflow in receiving devices.
4. **Media Access Control**: Manages how devices on a network gain access to the shared medium (wired or wireless).

***

### **2. Error Detection and Correction**

Error detection and correction are fundamental responsibilities of the Data Link Layer. It ensures the integrity of the data being transmitted across unreliable or noisy links. The most common methods are:

1. **Parity Check**: Adds a single bit (even or odd) to ensure that the total number of 1-bits in the data is even or odd.
   * **Example**: If the data has an odd number of 1s, the parity bit will be set to 1 to make the total number of 1s even.
2. **Checksums**: A value calculated from the data that is transmitted along with the data. The receiving system computes the checksum for the received data and compares it to the received checksum to check for errors.
   * **Example**: Used in protocols like TCP/IP.
3. **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**: A more advanced error detection method, where the sender calculates a polynomial checksum (CRC code), and the receiver performs a similar calculation. If the CRC values match, the data is considered error-free.
   * **Example**: Ethernet frames use CRC for error detection.
4. **Error Correction**: If errors are detected, the Data Link Layer may request retransmission of the corrupted data. In some protocols (like **Hamming Code**), errors can be corrected automatically.

***

### **3. Flow Control**

Flow control mechanisms ensure that a sender does not overwhelm the receiver with too much data at once. The Data Link Layer uses two main methods for flow control:

1. **Stop-and-Wait**: The sender sends one frame and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver before sending the next frame.
   * **Example**: Simple but inefficient in high-speed networks.
2. **Sliding Window Protocol**: Allows the sender to send multiple frames before receiving ACKs, with the receiver acknowledging a range of frames.
   * **Example**: More efficient than stop-and-wait and is commonly used in modern communication protocols like TCP.

### **4. Data Link Protocols**

Data Link Layer protocols define the rules for communication and data transfer on a link. Some popular protocols include:

1. **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)**: A widely used standard for local area networks (LANs). Ethernet uses the **CSMA/CD** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) protocol for media access control and frame delivery.
2. **IEEE 802.4 (Token Bus)**: A LAN protocol where a special frame called a **token** travels along a bus (single shared transmission medium). A device can only send data when it holds the token.
3. **IEEE 802.5 (Token Ring)**: Similar to Token Bus but uses a **ring topology** instead of a bus. A token circulates around the ring, and only the device that has the token can transmit data.
4. **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)**: The **Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)** is a **data link layer protocol** used to establish a direct connection between two network nodes. It is designed to enable communication over point-to-point links, meaning it connects two devices (e.g., two routers, a computer and a modem, or any pair of devices) directly without needing a shared medium, such as a hub or switch.
   * **Example**:
     * **Dial-up Internet Connections**: PPP was widely used in dial-up connections over telephone lines, where it provided a simple way to establish a direct communication link between the userâ€™s computer and the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
     * **Leased Line Connections**: PPP is often used in **dedicated leased line** connections between two sites, such as between corporate offices and remote locations.
     * **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: PPP can be used in certain VPN configurations, allowing secure communication between remote users and networks.
     * **DSL and Broadband**: PPPoE(PPP over Ethernet) is commonly used in DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) broadband connections, especially in residential broadband services.

### **5. Multiple Access Protocols**

When multiple devices share a common communication medium, **Multiple Access Protocols** govern how they access the medium to avoid collisions and ensure efficient data transfer. Some common protocols include:

1. **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)**:
   * Used in Ethernet networks, CSMA/CD allows devices to listen to the channel before transmitting data. If no other device is transmitting, it can send its data. If two devices transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs, and they both stop, wait a random amount of time, and retransmit.
   * **Example**: Used in **wired Ethernet** networks.
2. **CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)**:
   * Used in **wireless networks** (Wi-Fi), CSMA/CA minimizes the chances of collisions by having devices wait for a channel to be idle before transmitting.
3. **Polling**: In this method, a central device polls all devices on the network to see if they have data to transmit. If so, the device is granted access to the channel.
4. **Token Passing**: In this method, a special control frame (token) circulates through the network. Only the device holding the token can transmit data.
   * **Example**: Used in **Token Ring** and **Token Bus** networks.

### **6. LAN Addressing and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**

**LAN Addressing** refers to the use of physical addresses to uniquely identify devices within a local area network (LAN). In Ethernet networks, the unique hardware addresses are known as **MAC addresses** (Media Access Control addresses). Each device in a network has a MAC address, which is used to identify it on the network.

1. **MAC Address**: A unique identifier assigned to each network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer.
   * Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: A protocol used to map **IP addresses** to **MAC addresses** in a local network. When a device wants to send data to another device on the same LAN, it needs to know the target device's MAC address. ARP is used to resolve this mapping.

### **7. Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)**

**Ethernet** is the most widely used **LAN technology** and operates under the **IEEE 802.3** standard. Ethernet uses **CSMA/CD** for media access control and supports both wired and wireless LANs. It operates at speeds ranging from **10 Mbps** (traditional Ethernet) to **100 Gbps** (modern Ethernet). Ethernet has evolved over time, providing increasingly faster speeds and improved features. It is the dominant LAN technology used in homes, businesses, data centers, and other networked environments.

* **IEEE 802.3 Standard:** The IEEE 802.3 standard is the set of rules and protocols that defines Ethernet networking. It specifies the physical and data link layers of the OSI model. This standard covers the entire Ethernet architecture, from the types of cables and connectors to the protocol used for data transmission. Over time, the standard has evolved to support faster speeds and more reliable networking.
* **Ethernet and Full-Duplex Communication:** Ethernet traditionally used **half-duplex** communication, where data could only be transmitted in one direction at a time. However, modern Ethernet networks, especially those that use **switches**, support **full-duplex** communication, where data can be transmitted in both directions simultaneously. Full-duplex Ethernet eliminates the need for CSMA/CD, as there are no collisions.
* **Ethernet over Fiber (Fibre Channel):** In addition to copper-based Ethernet, Ethernet over **fiber optics** is used in large-scale networks. **Fibre Channel** is a high-speed networking technology that runs over fiber optic cables and is often used for storage area networks (SANs). Ethernet over fiber allows for high-speed, long-distance communication with minimal signal loss and high bandwidth.

Ethernet is flexible, operating on both wired and wireless LANs, and offers speeds that continue to grow to meet the demands of modern networking environments.

### **8. Wireless LANs (Wi-Fi)**

**Wireless Local Area Networks (Wi-Fi)** use radio waves to transmit data over short distances without the need for physical cables. Wi-Fi is governed by the **IEEE 802.11** standards, which define how devices like laptops, smartphones, tablets, and routers communicate wirelessly within a specific range. Wi-Fi enables devices to connect to the internet, share files, and communicate over a network without the constraints of wired connections.

Wi-Fi technology has evolved significantly, with each generation offering faster speeds, improved security, and better coverage. The various versions of **IEEE 802.11** define the different Wi-Fi standards, each with specific characteristics.

* **Wi-Fi standards** include 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, and the more recent **802.11ac** and **802.11ax**.
