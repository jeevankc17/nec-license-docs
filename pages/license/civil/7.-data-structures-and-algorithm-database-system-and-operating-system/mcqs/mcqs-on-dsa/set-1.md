#### 1. What is the difference between a primitive data type and an abstract data type in programming?

1. Primitive data types are basic and cannot be changed, while abstract data types can be modified.
2. Primitive data types are simple, while abstract data types are complex.
3. Primitive data types are defined by the programming language, while abstract data types are defined by the programmer.

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. Primitive data types are defined by the programming language, while abstract data types are defined by the programmer.

**Explanation:**

* **Primitive Data Types:** These are the basic data types provided by the programming language itself, such as `int`, `float`, `char`, etc. They are predefined and cannot be broken down into simpler data types.
* **Abstract Data Types (ADTs):** These are data types that are defined by the programmer. They are more complex and can be composed of primitive data types or other ADTs. Examples include stacks, queues, and lists. ADTs are defined by their behavior (operations) rather than their implementation.
* **Conclusion:** The key difference is that primitive data types are built into the language, while ADTs are user-defined and can encapsulate both data and operations.

**Explanation:**

* **FIFO Principle:** A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed.
* **Applications:** Queues are used in various applications such as task scheduling, print spooling, and breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs.
* **Conclusion:** The primary use of a queue is to store and retrieve data in a FIFO manner.

**Answer:** 2. Breadth-first search in a graph

**Explanation:**

* **Queue:** A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed.
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored.
* **Conclusion:** Queues are essential for implementing BFS, making them suitable for solving graph traversal problems.

3. It must be planar
4. It must be completely connected

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. It must contain no cycles

**Explanation:**

* **Tree:** A tree is a type of graph that must satisfy the following conditions:
  1. **No Cycles:** A tree must be acyclic, meaning it contains no cycles.
  2. **Connected:** A tree must be connected, meaning there is a path between any two vertices.
* **Conclusion:** A graph must be acyclic and connected to be considered a tree.

#### 42. Where are the elements of a linked list stored?

1. In a structure
2. In an array
3. Anywhere the computer has space for them
4. In contiguous memory locations

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. Anywhere the computer has space for them

**Explanation:**

* **Linked List:** In a linked list, elements (nodes) are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node contains a data field and a pointer to the next node, allowing the elements to be stored anywhere in memory.
* **Conclusion:** The elements of a linked list can be stored anywhere in memory, as long as each node points to the next node.

#### 43. What data structure would be best suited for implementing a parentheses checker program?

1. List
2. Queue
3. Stack
4. Any of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. Stack

**Explanation:**

* **Parentheses Checker:** A stack is ideal for checking balanced parentheses because it follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it is matched with the top element of the stack.
* **Conclusion:** A stack is the best data structure for implementing a parentheses checker program.
