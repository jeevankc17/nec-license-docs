1. Progressive dimensioning
2. Superimposed dimensioning
3. Continuous dimensioning
4. Coordinate dimensioning

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. Continuous dimensioning

**Explanation:**

* Chain dimensioning is also known as continuous dimensioning because it involves placing dimensions in a continuous line.
* Progressive dimensioning and superimposed dimensioning are not synonymous with chain dimensioning.

</details>

#### 46. In \_\_\_\_\_\_ a number of single dimensions parallel to one another are placed from a common origin.

1. Chain dimensioning
2. Parallel dimensioning
3. Combined dimensioning
4. Coordinate dimensioning

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. Parallel dimensioning

**Explanation:**

* Parallel dimensioning involves placing a number of single dimensions parallel to one another from a common origin.
* This method is useful for showing the dimensions of different features of an object.
* Chain dimensioning and combined dimensioning do not place dimensions parallel to each other.

#### 47. Parallel dimensioning is also known as \_\_\_\_\_\_.

1. Progressive dimensioning
2. Superimposed dimensioning
3. Continuous dimensioning
4. Coordinate dimensioning

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Progressive dimensioning

**Explanation:**

* Parallel dimensioning is also known as progressive dimensioning because it involves placing dimensions progressively from a common origin.
* Superimposed dimensioning and continuous dimensioning are not synonymous with parallel dimensioning.

#### 48. In \_\_\_\_\_\_ all the dimensions begin from a common origin, which is indicated by a small circle of 3mm diameter, and terminated with arrowheads where individual dimension ends.

1. Progressive dimensioning
2. Superimposed dimensioning
3. Continuous dimensioning
4. Running dimensioning

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Running dimensioning

**Explanation:**

* Running dimensioning involves placing all dimensions from a common origin, indicated by a small circle of 3mm diameter.
* Each dimension is terminated with arrowheads where the individual dimension ends.
* Progressive dimensioning and continuous dimensioning do not use this method.

</details>

#### 49. Running dimensioning is also known as \_\_\_\_\_\_.

1. Progressive dimensioning
2. Superimposed dimensioning
3. Continuous dimensioning
4. Coordinate dimensioning

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. Superimposed dimensioning

**Explanation:**

* Running dimensioning is also known as superimposed dimensioning because it involves superimposing dimensions from a common origin.
* Progressive dimensioning and continuous dimensioning are not synonymous with running dimensioning.

#### 50. \_\_\_\_\_\_ are used to represent real eye objects such as vehicles, large machine parts, Mountains, buildings, town plans etc.

1. Enlarging scales
2. Reducing scales
3. Full size scale
4. None of above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. Reducing scales

**Explanation:**

* Reducing scales are used to represent large objects like vehicles, buildings, and town plans in a smaller size on paper.
* Enlarging scales are used to represent small objects in a larger size.
* Full size scale represents objects in their actual size.
