3. Rs. 113.10
4. Rs. 143.10

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. Rs. 133.10

**Explanation:**

* The formula for compound interest is $$A = P(1 + r)^n$$, where:
  * $$A$$ is the amount after interest.
  * $$P$$ is the principal amount (Rs 100).
  * $$r$$ is the annual interest rate (10% or 0.10).
  * $$n$$ is the number of years (3).
* Plugging in the values: $$A = 100(1 + 0.10)^3 = 100(1.331) = 133.10$$.
* Therefore, the total amount after 3 years is Rs. 133.10.

4. None of the Above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. A dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received in the future

**Explanation:**

* The time value of money (TVM) principle states that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity.
* This is because money can earn interest or be invested, generating more money over time.
* Therefore, a dollar received today is more valuable than a dollar received in the future.

</details>

4. Money has no value unless it is invested

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Money is worth more in the present than in the future

**Explanation:**

* The time value of money (TVM) principle emphasizes that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future.
* This is because money can be invested or earn interest, increasing its value over time.
* The other options do not accurately describe the concept of TVM.

</details>

### 14. Which of the following is NOT a factor in the time value of money?

1. Interest Rate
2. Time Period
3. Inflation
4. Tax Rate

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Tax Rate

**Explanation:**

* The time value of money (TVM) is influenced by factors such as interest rate, time period, and inflation.
* Tax rate, while important in financial planning, is not a direct factor in the calculation of TVM.
* Therefore, tax rate is not considered in the time value of money.

</details>

### 15. What is the formula for calculating future value?

1. $$PV = FV / (1 + r)^n$$
2. $$FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n$$

4. $$PV = FV \times (1 + r)^n$$

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. $$FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n$$

**Explanation:**

* The future value (FV) formula calculates the value of an investment at a future date based on the present value (PV), interest rate (r), and time period (n).
* The correct formula is $$FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n$$.
* The other options either represent the present value formula or are incorrect variations.

</details>

### 16. Which of the following is a measure of the rate of return on an investment?

1. Present value
2. Future value
3. Net present value
4. Internal rate of return

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Internal rate of return

**Explanation:**

* The internal rate of return (IRR) is a measure of the profitability of an investment.
* It represents the discount rate at which the net present value (NPV) of an investment becomes zero.
* Present value, future value, and net present value are not measures of the rate of return.

</details>

### 17. What will be the relationship between annual nominal rate of interest and annual effective rate of interest, if frequency of compounding is greater than one?

1. Effective rate > Nominal rate
2. Effective rate < Nominal rate
3. Effective rate = Nominal rate
4. None of the Above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Effective rate > Nominal rate

**Explanation:**

* When the frequency of compounding is greater than one, the effective annual rate (EAR) will be higher than the nominal annual rate.
* This is because compounding more frequently results in more interest being earned on interest.
* Therefore, the effective rate is greater than the nominal rate.

</details>

### 18. Key factor in determining the time value of money?

1. Discount rate
2. Commission
3. Interest rate
4. All of the Above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. Interest rate

**Explanation:**

* The interest rate is a key factor in determining the time value of money (TVM).
* It affects the present value and future value of money by determining how much money can grow over time.
* While discount rate and commission are important, they are not the primary factors in TVM.

</details>

### 21. The relationship between effective interest rate 'i' and nominal interest rate 'r' is

1. $$i = (1 + r/M)^M - 1$$
2. $$i = (1 + M/r)^M - 1$$
3. $$i = (1 + r/M)^M$$
4. $$i = (1 + r/M) - 1$$

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. $$i = (1 + r/M)^M - 1$$

**Explanation:**

* The effective interest rate (i) is calculated using the nominal interest rate (r) and the number of compounding periods per year (M).
* The formula is $$i = (1 + r/M)^M - 1$$.
* This formula accounts for the effect of compounding on the nominal rate.

</details>

3. Both of the Above
4. None of the Above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. The project is expected to generate more cash flows than the initial investment

**Explanation:**

* A positive Net Present Value (NPV) indicates that the present value of future cash flows is greater than the initial investment.
* This means the project is expected to be profitable and generate more cash flows than the cost of the investment.
