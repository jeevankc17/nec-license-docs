2. Parameter, or local
3. Both A and B
4. Only parameter

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Attribute, or global

**Explanation:**

* An attribute or global variable provides a relatively permanent connection between sender and receiver objects, as it persists throughout the object's lifecycle.

</details>

#### 416. Which would you use if you didnâ€™t want a permanent connection?

1. Parameter, or local
2. Attribute, or global
3. Both A and B
4. Only Attribute

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Parameter, or local

</details>

#### 428. Given this class diagram, suppose we execute the following code:

1. In Minivan
2. In Minivan or Car
3. In Minivan, Car, or Vehicle
4. In Car
5. In Car or Vehicle

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. In Minivan, Car, or Vehicle

**Explanation:**

* The `drivesOnRoad()` method could be defined in Minivan, Car, or Vehicle, as Minivan inherits from Car, which inherits from Vehicle. The method could be overridden in any of these classes.

</details>

#### 429. Given this class diagram, suppose there is a method pass, defined in Car as

Suppose imp is an instance of Car (or one of its subtypes).

When I invoke the above method using imp.pass(pokey), what must be true of actual parameter pokey?

1. Its actual type is Car
2. Its actual type is Car, SportsCar, or Minivan
3. Its actual type is Car or Vehicle
4. It depends on the actual type of imp
5. None of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. Its actual type is Car, SportsCar, or Minivan

**Explanation:**

* The parameter `pokey` must be of type `Car` or one of its subtypes (`SportsCar` or `Minivan`). This is because the method `pass` is defined to accept a parameter of type `Car`.

</details>

#### 430. Given the below class diagram and code fragment, what happens?

1. The code compiles and executes fine
2. Code fails at compile time, error in line 2
3. Code fails at compile time, error in line 5 \[correct]
4. Code fails at execution time, error in line 2
5. Code fails at execution time, error in line 5

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. Code fails at compile time, error in line 5

**Explanation:**

* The code fails at compile time because the `Garage` class does not have a `parkCar` method defined. This results in a compilation error in line 5.

</details>

1. Yes
2. No

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Yes

**Explanation:**

* The sequence of messages in an interaction diagram translates directly to a series of statements in the method definitions. This helps in implementing the behavior defined in the interaction diagram.

</details>

#### 434. One-to-many relationships are common. For example, a Sale is associated with a group of SalesLineItem objects. In OO programming languages, these relationships are usually implemented using collection objects such as Vectors, Lists, Maps, arrays and so on. In which phase these relations are maintained?

2. CONTAINER/COLLECTION CLASSES IN CODE
3. ORDER OF IMPLEMENTATION
4. EXCEPTIONS AND ERROR HANDLING

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. CONTAINER/COLLECTION CLASSES IN CODE

**Explanation:**

* One-to-many relationships are implemented using container/collection classes such as Vectors, Lists, or Maps. These relationships are maintained during the implementation phase.

</details>

#### 436. In order of implementation phase, Classes need to be implemented (and ideally, fully unit tested) from least-coupled to most-coupled. Is this statement true?

1. Yes
2. No

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Yes

**Explanation:**

* Classes should be implemented and unit tested from least-coupled to most-coupled to ensure that dependencies are managed effectively and testing can be done incrementally.

</details>

#### 437. \_\_\_\_\_\_ are anomalous situations during a program's execution.

1. Exceptions
2. Errors
3. Delay
4. Noise

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. Exceptions

**Explanation:**

* Exceptions are anomalous situations that occur during a program's execution, such as invalid input or resource unavailability. They are used to handle unexpected events gracefully.

#### 438. The unexpected situations that may occur during program execution are

1. Running out of memory
2. Resource allocation errors
3. Inability to find a file
4. Problems in network

**Answer:** 5. All of the above

**Explanation:**

* Unexpected situations during program execution include running out of memory, resource allocation errors, inability to find a file, and network problems. These are all examples of exceptions.

</details>

#### 439. Every try statement should be followed by at least one catch statement; otherwise \_\_\_\_\_\_ will occur.

1. No execution
2. Null
3. Zero
4. Compilation error

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Compilation error

**Explanation:**

* In most programming languages, a `try` block must be followed by at least one `catch` block or a `finally` block. If not, a compilation error will occur.

</details>

#### 440. State whether the following statements are True or False.

1. A catch can have comma-separated multiple arguments.
2. Throwing an Exception always causes program termination.
3. True, False
4. False, True
5. True, True
6. False, False

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1. True, False

**Explanation:**

* A `catch` block can have multiple arguments separated by commas in some languages (e.g., Java 7+). However, throwing an exception does not always cause program termination; it depends on whether the exception is caught and handled.
