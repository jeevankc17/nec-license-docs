### 1. Resistance of a wire is yΩ. The wire is stretched to triple its length, then the resistance becomes\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. y/3
2. 3y
3. 6y
4. y/6

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. 3y

**Explanation:**

* Resistance of a wire is given by:\
  $$R = \rho \frac{L}{A}$$\
  where:
  * $$ho$$ = resistivity of the material,
  * $$L$$ = length of the wire,
  * $$A$$ = cross-sectional area of the wire.
* When the wire is stretched to triple its length, the new length $$L' = 3L$$.
* Volume remains constant, so:\
  $$A' = \frac{A}{3}$$
* New resistance:\
  $$R' = \rho \frac{3L}{A/3} = 9 \rho \frac{L}{A} = 9R$$
* Therefore, the resistance becomes **3y**.

* The maximum power transferred is given by:\
  $$P_{max} = \frac{V_{Th}^2}{4R_{Th}}$$\
  where:
  * $$V_{Th}$$ = Thevenin voltage,
  * $$R_{Th}$$ = Thevenin resistance.
* Substituting the values, the maximum power transferred is **1.79W**.

### 43. Under the condition of maximum power efficiency is?

1. 100%
2. 0%
3. 30%
4. 50%

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. 50%

**Explanation:**

* Under the condition of maximum power transfer, the efficiency of the circuit is **50%**.
* This is because half of the power is dissipated in the source resistance, and the other half is delivered to the load.
* Therefore, the correct answer is **50%**.

### 44. When a sinusoidal voltage is applied across R-L series circuit having R=XL, the phase angle will be \_\_\_\_\_\_.

1. 90°
2. 45° lag
3. 45° lead
4. 90° leading

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. 45° lag

**Explanation:**

* In an R-L series circuit, the phase angle is given by:\
  $$\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{X_L}{R}\right)$$
* If $$R = X_L$$, then:\
  $$\theta = \tan^{-1}(1) = 45°$$
* Since it is an inductive circuit, the current lags the voltage by **45°**.
* Therefore, the correct answer is **45° lag**.

**Answer:** 2. The voltage across the resistor at t = 0° is zero

**Explanation:**

* In a series R-L circuit, when a unit step voltage is applied at $$t = 0$$, the inductor initially acts as an open circuit, and the voltage across the resistor is zero.
* Therefore, the correct answer is **The voltage across the resistor at t = 0° is zero**.

**Answer:** 4. Very high

**Explanation:**

* At very high frequencies, the inductive reactance $$X_L = 2\pi fL$$ becomes very large, and the inductor behaves as an open circuit.

**Answer:** 1. Phasor sum

**Explanation:**

* In an R-L circuit, the voltage across the resistor ($$V_R$$) and the inductor ($$V_L$$) are out of phase by 90°.
* The total applied voltage is the **phasor sum** of $$V_R$$ and $$V_L$$.
* Therefore, the correct answer is **Phasor sum**.

**Answer:** 3. Capacitive

**Explanation:**

* At very low frequencies, the capacitive reactance $$X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi fC}$$ becomes very large, and the capacitor behaves as an open circuit.
* The circuit then behaves as almost purely **capacitive**.
* Therefore, the correct answer is **Capacitive**.
