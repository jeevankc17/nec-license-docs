# 1.6 Amplifiers

### 1. **Classification of Output Stages: Class A, Class B, and Class AB Stages**

Amplifiers are classified based on their output stages and efficiency. The output stage of an amplifier determines the linearity, efficiency, and power handling of the amplifier. The common classes of amplifier output stages are **Class A**, **Class B**, and **Class AB**.

**Class A Amplifier**

* **Operation**: In a Class A amplifier, the output transistor conducts for the entire cycle (360°) of the input signal. This means the transistor is always on, regardless of the input signal's magnitude.
* **Advantages**:
  * High linearity: The output is a faithful reproduction of the input signal, with minimal distortion.
  * Low harmonic distortion.
* **Disadvantages**:
  * **Low efficiency**: Due to continuous conduction, Class A amplifiers are not power-efficient (around 25-30%).
  * **Heat generation**: High power loss results in significant heat dissipation.
* **Application**: Used in high-fidelity audio systems and situations where minimal distortion is crucial.

**Class B Amplifier**

* **Operation**: In a Class B amplifier, the output transistor conducts for half (180°) of the input signal cycle. Two transistors are used, each amplifying one half of the waveform (positive or negative).
* **Advantages**:
  * **Higher efficiency**: Class B amplifiers are more efficient than Class A (around 50-60%).
* **Disadvantages**:
  * **Crossover distortion**: At the point where the two transistors switch between conducting and non-conducting states, distortion can occur, leading to non-linearities.
* **Application**: Used in power amplifiers for radio frequency (RF) systems and audio systems where efficiency is important.

**Class AB Amplifier**

* **Operation**: Class AB amplifiers combine the advantages of Class A and Class B amplifiers. The output transistors conduct for more than half (180°) but less than the entire input signal cycle (less than 360°). This reduces crossover distortion while maintaining better efficiency than Class A.
* **Advantages**:
  * **Better efficiency**: Class AB amplifiers are more efficient than Class A but provide less distortion than Class B (around 50-70%).
  * **Reduced crossover distortion**: Through careful biasing, the distortion at the crossover point can be minimized.
* **Disadvantages**:
  * Slightly higher distortion than Class A.
* **Application**: Widely used in audio power amplifiers, such as in car audio systems, home theater systems, and professional audio equipment.

### **2. Biasing, Power BJTs, Transformer-Coupled Push-Pull Stages, Tuned Amplifiers, and Op-Amps**

**Biasing**

* **Biasing** in amplifiers refers to setting the operating point of the transistor to ensure it operates in the desired region of the output characteristic curve. Proper biasing is crucial for linear amplification and to avoid distortion.
* **Types of Biasing**:
  * **Fixed bias**: The base bias voltage is applied through a resistor.
  * **Self-bias** (or emitter-bias): The biasing resistor is placed in the emitter leg of the transistor to stabilize the operating point.

**Power BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors)**

* **Power BJTs** are used in high-power applications, where large current and voltage handling are required. These BJTs are designed to amplify large signals and deliver significant power to the load (e.g., in audio or RF amplifiers).
* **Key Parameters**: The key parameters for power BJTs are **current gain**, **saturation voltage**, and **power dissipation**.

**Transformer-Coupled Push-Pull Stages**

* **Push-Pull Amplifiers** use two transistors (or tubes) that operate in opposite phases (one amplifies the positive half, the other amplifies the negative half of the input signal).
* **Transformer Coupling**: A transformer is used to combine the outputs of both transistors into a single output, ensuring that the amplifier provides a larger voltage swing and increased efficiency.
* **Advantages**:
  * High efficiency.
  * Reduced distortion (no crossover distortion as in Class B).
  * Suitable for high-power applications.
* **Application**: Common in audio power amplifiers and RF amplifiers.

**Tuned Amplifiers**

* **Tuned Amplifiers** are amplifiers designed to work at a specific frequency or range of frequencies, achieved by using **resonant circuits** (LC circuits) in the amplifier's feedback or load.
* **Application**: Used in radio frequency (RF) applications such as radio transmitters and receivers, where only a specific frequency needs to be amplified.

**Op-Amps (Operational Amplifiers)**

* **Op-Amps** are versatile, high-gain electronic voltage amplifiers with differential inputs. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including signal processing, control systems, and filters.
* **Ideal Characteristics**: Infinite open-loop gain, infinite input impedance, and zero output impedance (in ideal cases).
* **Applications**:
  * Used in audio amplification, filtering, and signal conditioning.
  * Active filters, oscillators, and buffers.
