4. None of the Above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1) Methods with the same name create ambiguity and conflict

**Explanation:**

* The **diamond problem** arises in **multiple inheritance** when:
  * Two base classes have methods with the same name.
  * The derived class faces ambiguity in choosing which method to call.
* Therefore, the correct answer is `Methods with the same name create ambiguity and conflict`.
