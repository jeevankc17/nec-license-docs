#### 101. Why do we use a destructor in C++?

1. To destroy an object when the lifetime of the object ends
2. To create an object when the object needs to be created
3. To initialize the data members of an object when it is created
4. None of the Above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 1) To destroy an object when the lifetime of the object ends

**Explanation:**

* A **destructor** is used to:
  * Release resources (e.g., memory, file handles) allocated to an object.
  * Perform cleanup tasks when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
* Therefore, the correct answer is `To destroy an object when the lifetime of the object ends`.

</details>

#### 102. A destructor is preceded by:

1. /
2. |
3. ?
4. \~

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4) \~

**Explanation:**

* A **destructor** is preceded by the **tilde symbol (`~`)**.
*   For example:

    ```cpp
    class MyClass {
    public:
        ~MyClass() {
            cout << "Destructor called!";
        }
    };
    ```
* Therefore, the correct answer is `~`.

</details>

#### 103. Which of the following statements is correct?

1. A constructor has the same name as that of the class
2. A destructor has the same name as that of the class with a tilde symbol at the beginning.
3. A constructor is a member function of the class
4. All of the Above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4) All of the Above

**Explanation:**

* All the statements are correct:
  * A **constructor** has the same name as the class.
  * A **destructor** has the same name as the class but is preceded by a tilde (`~`).
  * Both constructors and destructors are **member functions** of the class.
* Therefore, the correct answer is `All of the Above`.

</details>
