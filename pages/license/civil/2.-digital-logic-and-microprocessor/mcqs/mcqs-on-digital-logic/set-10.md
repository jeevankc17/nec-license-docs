* Therefore, the correct answer is **100Hz**.

#### 498. In a certain digital waveform, the period is twice the pulse width. The duty cycle is

1. 100%
2. 50%
3. 200%
4. 150%

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 2. 50%

**Explanation:**

* If the period is twice the pulse width, the duty cycle is:\
  $$\text{Duty Cycle} = \frac{\text{Pulse Width}}{\text{Period}} \times 100 = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\%$$
* Therefore, the correct answer is **50%**.

#### 499. An inverter

1. Performs the NOT operation
2. Changes a LOW to a HIGH
3. Changes a HIGH to a LOW
4. Does all of the above

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 4. Does all of the above

**Explanation:**

* An inverter **performs the NOT operation**, **changes a LOW to a HIGH**, and **changes a HIGH to a LOW**.
* Therefore, the correct answer is **Does all of the above**.

</details>

#### 500. The output of an AND gate is HIGH when

1. Any input is HIGH
2. No inputs are HIGH
3. All inputs are HIGH
4. Both answers (A) and (C)

<details>

<summary>Show me the answer</summary>

**Answer:** 3. All inputs are HIGH

**Explanation:**

* The output of an AND gate is **HIGH** only when **all inputs are HIGH**.
* Therefore, the correct answer is **All inputs are HIGH**.
