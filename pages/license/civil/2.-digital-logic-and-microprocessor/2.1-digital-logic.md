# 2.1 Digital Logic

### 1. **Number Systems, Logic Levels, Logic Gates, Boolean Algebra**

**Number Systems**

* **Binary System**: A number system that uses only two digits, `0` and `1`. It is the foundation of digital electronics.
* **Decimal System**: The standard number system used in everyday life, consisting of digits `0-9`.
* **Octal System**: A base-8 number system using digits `0-7`. It is often used in computing as a shorthand for binary numbers.
* **Hexadecimal System**: A base-16 number system using digits `0-9` and letters `A-F` (representing values 10-15). It is commonly used in programming to represent binary data more compactly.

**Logic Levels**

* **High (1)**: Represents a logic high or "true" state, typically corresponding to a voltage near the supply voltage (e.g., 5V).
* **Low (0)**: Represents a logic low or "false" state, typically corresponding to a ground or low voltage (e.g., 0V).

**Logic Gates**

Logic gates are the basic building blocks of digital circuits. They perform logical operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a binary output.

* **AND Gate**: Output is `1` only if both inputs are `1`.
* **OR Gate**: Output is `1` if at least one input is `1`.
* **NOT Gate (Inverter)**: Output is the inverse of the input. If input is `1`, output is `0`, and vice versa.
* **NAND Gate**: Output is the inverse of the AND gate. Output is `1` except when both inputs are `1`.
* **NOR Gate**: Output is the inverse of the OR gate. Output is `1` only when both inputs are `0`.
* **XOR Gate**: Output is `1` if the inputs are different.
* **XNOR Gate**: Output is `1` if the inputs are the same.

**Boolean Algebra**

* **Boolean Variables**: These variables represent two possible states, `0` and `1`.
* **Basic Operations**:
  * **AND**: `A * B` or `A AND B`
  * **OR**: `A + B` or `A OR B`
  * **NOT**: `¬A` or `NOT A`
* **Boolean Laws**:
  * **Commutative**: `A + B = B + A`, `A * B = B * A`
  * **Associative**: `(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)`, `(A * B) * C = A * (B * C)`
  * **Distributive**: `A * (B + C) = (A * B) + (A * C)`
  * **Identity**: `A + 0 = A`, `A * 1 = A`
  * **Null**: `A + 1 = 1`, `A * 0 = 0`
  * **Complement**: `A + ¬A = 1`, `A * ¬A = 0`

### **2. Sum-of-Products and Product-of-Sums Methods**

**Sum-of-Products (SOP)**

* **Definition**: SOP is a Boolean expression where several product terms (AND operations) are summed (OR operations).
* **Example**: The Boolean expression `A * B + C` is in SOP form. The terms `A * B` and `C` are the product terms, and they are summed with the OR operator.
* **Application**: SOP is often used in designing digital circuits with AND and OR gates.

**Product-of-Sums (POS)**

* **Definition**: POS is a Boolean expression where several sum terms (OR operations) are multiplied (AND operations).
* **Example**: The Boolean expression `(A + B) * (C + D)` is in POS form. The terms `(A + B)` and `(C + D)` are sum terms, and they are multiplied with the AND operator.
* **Application**: POS is used in digital circuit design when the expression needs to be implemented with NAND gates.

### **3. Truth Tables and Karnaugh Maps**

**Truth Tables**

* A **truth table** is a tabular representation of all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs for a Boolean function or logic circuit.
* **Steps to Create a Truth Table**:
  1. List all possible input combinations.
  2. Determine the output for each combination based on the Boolean expression or circuit.
  3. Present the results in a table format.
* **Example** for a 2-input AND gate:

| A | B | Output(A and B) |
| - | - | --------------- |
| 0 | 0 | 0               |
| 0 | 1 | 0               |
| 1 | 0 | 0               |
| 1 | 1 | 1               |

**Karnaugh Maps (K-map)**

* A **Karnaugh map** is a graphical representation used to simplify Boolean expressions. It helps identify patterns in the truth table to minimize the Boolean expression.
* **Steps to Use K-map**:
  1. Construct a K-map grid with cells representing all possible input combinations.
  2. Place the output values from the truth table into the corresponding cells.
  3. Group adjacent cells with `1`s in powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).
  4. Write the simplified Boolean expression based on the grouped cells.
* **Example** for a 2-variable K-map:

| A\B | 0 | 1 |
| --- | - | - |
| 0   | 0 | 1 |
| 1   | 1 | 1 |

The simplified Boolean expression for this K-map is: **A + B**.

### Conclusion

Understanding number systems, logic levels, gates, and Boolean algebra is fundamental to digital electronics. Sum-of-Products (SOP) and Product-of-Sums (POS) methods simplify logic expressions for circuit design. Truth tables outline all input-output possibilities, while Karnaugh maps minimize Boolean expressions, optimizing circuit efficiency. These concepts enable the design of reliable and efficient digital systems.
