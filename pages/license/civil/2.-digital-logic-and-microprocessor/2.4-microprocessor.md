**Understanding the architecture flow of 8085 microprocessor**

The architecture of the 8085 microprocessor is designed to execute instructions in a sequence of operations, including fetching, decoding, and executing, while handling external events such as interrupts. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the flow and components involved:

***

**1. Fetch Phase**

* **Program Counter (PC):**
  * The PC holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
  * It sends this address via the **Address Bus** to the memory.
* **Memory Unit:**
  * The memory receives the address and places the corresponding instruction on the **Data Bus**.
  * This instruction is then sent to the **Instruction Register (IR)** in the microprocessor.
* **Instruction Register (IR):**
  * The instruction fetched from memory is stored in the IR.
  * This marks the end of the fetching phase.

***

**2. Decode Phase**

* **Instruction Decoder:**
  * The instruction stored in the IR is decoded by the **Instruction Decoder**.
  * The decoder interprets the opcode and determines the operations to be performed.
* **Timing and Control Circuit:**
  * Based on the decoded instruction, the **Timing and Control Circuit** generates appropriate control signals.
  * These signals direct the flow of data between registers, memory, and the **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)**.

***

**3. Execute Phase**

* **Control Signals:**
  * The control signals guide the flow of data:
    * **Registers:** Data required for the operation is fetched from the appropriate register.
    * **ALU:** The ALU performs the necessary calculation or logical operation. ALU role is to generate the result and also the status. Result stored on the accumulator while status if exist in the flag.
* **Accumulator (A):**
  * The result of the operation is stored in the **Accumulator**, which serves as a primary data register for the microprocessor.
* **Flags Register:**
  * The **Flags Register** is updated based on the result in the accumulator.
  * It holds information about the status of the result, such as:
    * Zero (Z), Sign (S), Carry (CY), Parity (P), and Auxiliary Carry (AC) flags.

***

**4. Program Counter Increment**

* **Increment/Decrement Circuit (ICR/DCR):**
  * After fetching an instruction, the **Increment/Decrement Circuit** increments the PC to point to the next instruction in sequence.
  * Similarly, it also manages the stack pointer during stack operations by incrementing/decrementing the address.

***

**5. Interrupts**

* **Interrupt Handling:**
  * If an interrupt is triggered, the current operation is paused, and the processor executes the **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**.
  * After handling the interrupt, the processor resumes the normal execution flow.

***

**6. Temporary Register (WZ)**

* The **WZ Register Pair** is used internally to hold temporary data during multi-step operations.
  * For example, in memory-related operations, WZ temporarily holds intermediate addresses or values.

### 8086 Microprocessor

It is an enhanced version of 8085 Microprocessor that was designed by Intel in 1976.  It is a 16-bit microprocessor designed by Intel in 1978 using HMOS technology.

**Configuration:**

* 16-bit data bus
* 20-bit address bus, which can address up to 1MB
* 16-bit instruction pointer (IP) and stack pointer (SP)
* Four 16-bit general-purpose registers: AX, BX, CX, DX
* Four segment registers: CS, DS, SS, ES (64KB each)
* 6-byte instruction queue for pipelined execution
* Requires +5V supply to operate at 5-10 MHz
* Used in applications like personal computers, robotics, industrial control systems, and embedded systems.

**Understanding the architecture flow of 8086 microprocessor**

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the flow and components involved:

**1. Fetch Phase**

* **Program Counter (IP - Instruction Pointer):**
  * Holds the **offset address** of the next instruction within the **Code Segment (CS)**.
  * The **CS:IP pair** forms the full 20-bit physical address of the instruction in memory.
* **Bus Interface Unit (BIU):**
  * Sends this address to the memory via the **Address Bus**.
  * Fetches the instruction and stores it in the **Instruction Queue (6-byte FIFO buffer)**.
* **Instruction Queue:**
  * While the **Execution Unit (EU)** is decoding and executing the current instruction, the BIU fetches the next instruction to optimize processing time.

***

**2. Decode Phase**

* **Instruction Decoder (Part of EU):**
  * Fetches the instruction from the **Instruction Queue**.
  * Decodes the operation (opcode) and determines the required operands, addressing modes, and control signals.
  * Prepares the **Timing and Control Unit** to generate signals for data transfer and ALU operations.

***

**3. Execute Phase**

* **Execution Unit (EU):**
  * The decoded instruction guides the EU to perform the operation:
    * Data is fetched from the **General Registers**, **Memory**, or **I/O Ports** as needed.
    * The **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)** performs calculations or logical operations.
    * Results are stored in the appropriate register or memory.
* **Flags Register:**
  * The **Flags Register** is updated based on the result of the operation, reflecting the status (e.g., Zero, Carry, Overflow).
* **Stack Pointer (SP):**
  * If the operation involves function calls or interrupts, the SP manages **push/pop operations** to save or restore return addresses and data.
* **Interrupts (if any):**
  * If an interrupt occurs, the current instruction is paused, the context is saved on the **Stack**, and the **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** executes.

***

**4. Fetch-Execute Overlap (Pipelining)**

* While the EU decodes and executes the current instruction, the **BIU fetches the next instruction**, maintaining an overlap that speeds up processing.

### 2. Assembly Language Programming

**Introduction to Assembly Language**

* **Assembly language** is a low-level programming language that provides a direct correspondence between the instructions written by the programmer and the machine code understood by the microprocessor.
* Each instruction in assembly language corresponds to a single machine code instruction, making it more efficient than high-level programming languages.
* Assembly language uses **mnemonics** (symbolic representations) to represent machine instructions, making it easier for humans to write and understand.

**Basic Assembly Language Instructions**

* **Data Movement**: Moves data between registers or memory.
  * Example: `MOV A, B` (Move the value in register B to register A).
* **Arithmetic Operations**: Performs arithmetic calculations.
  * Example: `ADD A, B` (Add the value in register B to register A).
* **Logic Operations**: Performs logical operations.
  * Example: `AND A, B` (Perform a bitwise AND operation between registers A and B).
* **Branching**: Changes the flow of program execution.
  * Example: `JMP address` (Jump to the specified memory address).
* **Control Instructions**: Used to control the execution flow.
  * Example: `HALT` (Stops program execution).

**Example of Assembly Language Program**

A simple program to add two numbers:

```assembly
MOV A, 5     ; Move 5 into register A
MOV B, 3     ; Move 3 into register B
ADD A, B     ; Add the contents of register B to A
```

### Conclusion

A microprocessor is a small, integrated circuit (IC) that performs the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU):&#x20;

Microprocessors perform arithmetic, logic, and control functions on digital signals. They accept binary data as input, process it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provide results in binary form as output.&#x20;

Microprocessors are clock-driven, register-based, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.
