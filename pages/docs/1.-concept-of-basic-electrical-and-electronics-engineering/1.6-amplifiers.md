# 1.6 Amplifiers

### 1. **Classification of Output Stages: Class A, Class B, and Class AB Stages**

Amplifiers are classified based on their output stages and efficiency. The output stage of an amplifier determines the linearity, efficiency, and power handling of the amplifier. The common classes of amplifier output stages are **Class A**, **Class B**, and **Class AB**.

**Class A Amplifier**

* **Operation**: In a Class A amplifier, the output transistor conducts for the entire cycle (360째) of the input signal. This means the transistor is always on, regardless of the input signal's magnitude.
* **Advantages**:
  * High linearity: The output is a faithful reproduction of the input signal, with minimal distortion.
  * Low harmonic distortion.
* **Disadvantages**:
  * **Low efficiency**: Due to continuous conduction, Class A amplifiers are not power-efficient (around 25-30%).
  * **Heat generation**: High power loss results in significant heat dissipation.
* **Application**: Used in high-fidelity audio systems and situations where minimal distortion is crucial.

**Class B Amplifier**

* **Operation**: In a Class B amplifier, the output transistor conducts for half (180째) of the input signal cycle. Two transistors are used, each amplifying one half of the waveform (positive or negative).
* **Advantages**:
  * **Higher efficiency**: Class B amplifiers are more efficient than Class A (around 50-60%).
* **Disadvantages**:
  * **Crossover distortion**: At the point where the two transistors switch between conducting and non-conducting states, distortion can occur, leading to non-linearities.
* **Application**: Used in power amplifiers for radio frequency (RF) systems and audio systems where efficiency is important.

**Class AB Amplifier**

* **Operation**: Class AB amplifiers combine the advantages of Class A and Class B amplifiers. The output transistors conduct for more than half (180째) but less than the entire input signal cycle (less than 360째). This reduces crossover distortion while maintaining better efficiency than Class A.
* **Advantages**:
  * **Better efficiency**: Class AB amplifiers are more efficient than Class A but provide less distortion than Class B (around 50-70%).
  * **Reduced crossover distortion**: Through careful biasing, the distortion at the crossover point can be minimized.
* **Disadvantages**:
  * Slightly higher distortion than Class A.
* **Application**: Widely used in audio power amplifiers, such as in car audio systems, home theater systems, and professional audio equipment.
