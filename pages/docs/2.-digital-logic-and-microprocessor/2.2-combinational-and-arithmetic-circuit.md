# 2.2 Combinational & Arithmetic Circuit

### 1. Multiplexers, Demultiplexers, Decoders, and Encoders

**Multiplexers (MUX)**

A **multiplexer** is a combinational circuit that selects one of many inputs and forwards it to a single output line.

* It has **n** data inputs, 1 output, and $$\log_2(n)$$ selection lines.
* **Example**: A 4-to-1 multiplexer has 4 data inputs, 1 output, and 2 selection lines ($$S_1, S_0$$).

**Truth Table for 4-to-1 MUX:**

| $$S_1$$ | $$S_0$$ | Output  |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0       | 0       | $$D_0$$ |
| 0       | 1       | $$D_1$$ |
| 1       | 0       | $$D_2$$ |
| 1       | 1       | $$D_3$$ |

**Demultiplexers (DEMUX)**

A **demultiplexer** takes a single input and routes it to one of many output lines.

* It has 1 input, **n** outputs, and $$\log_2(n)$$ selection lines.
* **Example**: A 1-to-4 demultiplexer takes 1 input and routes it to one of the 4 output lines based on the selection lines ($$S_1, S_0$$).

**Truth Table for 1-to-4 DEMUX:**

| $$S_1$$ | $$S_0$$ | $$Y_0$$ | $$Y_1$$ | $$Y_2$$ | $$Y_3$$ |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0       | 0       | 1       | 0       | 0       | 0       |
| 0       | 1       | 0       | 1       | 0       | 0       |
| 1       | 0       | 0       | 0       | 1       | 0       |
| 1       | 1       | 0       | 0       | 0       | 1       |

***

**Decoders**

A **decoder** is a combinational circuit that decodes an $$n$$-bit input to a corresponding $$2^n$$ output.

* It converts binary information into a specific code.
* **Example**: A 2-to-4 decoder takes a 2-bit input and produces 4 outputs, with one of the outputs being 1 based on the input.

**Truth Table for 2-to-4 Decoder:**

| $$A_1$$ | $$A_0$$ | $$Y_0$$ | $$Y_1$$ | $$Y_2$$ | $$Y_3$$ |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0       | 0       | 1       | 0       | 0       | 0       |
| 0       | 1       | 0       | 1       | 0       | 0       |
| 1       | 0       | 0       | 0       | 1       | 0       |
| 1       | 1       | 0       | 0       | 0       | 1       |

***

**Encoders**

An **encoder** is the reverse of a decoder. It encodes an **n**-input into a $$\log_2(n)$$-bit output.

* **Example**: A 4-to-2 encoder takes 4 inputs and produces a 2-bit binary code corresponding to the active input.

**Truth Table for 4-to-2 Encoder:**

| $$D_3$$ | $$D_2$$ | $$D_1$$ | $$D_0$$ | $$A_1$$ | $$A_0$$ |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0       | 0       | 0       | 1       | 0       | 0       |
| 0       | 0       | 1       | 0       | 0       | 1       |
| 0       | 1       | 0       | 0       | 1       | 0       |
| 1       | 0       | 0       | 0       | 1       | 1       |

### 2. Binary Addition and Subtraction

**Binary Addition**

* Binary addition is similar to decimal addition but operates with base 2 (digits `0` and `1`).
* **Rules for binary addition**:
  * `0 + 0 = 0`
  * `0 + 1 = 1`
  * `1 + 0 = 1`
  * `1 + 1 = 10` (carry `1` to the next higher bit)

**Binary Subtraction**

* Binary subtraction follows the same concept as decimal subtraction.
* **Rules for binary subtraction**:
  * `0 - 0 = 0`&#x20;
  * `1 - 0 = 1`
  * `10 - 1 = 1` (borrow `1` from the next higher bit)
  * `1 - 1 = 0`

***

### 3. Operations on Signed and Unsigned Binary Numbers

**Unsigned Binary Numbers**

* In unsigned binary, all bits are used to represent the value. There is no sign bit, so the number can only represent non-negative values.
* **Example**: `1011` (binary) = `11` (decimal)

**Signed Binary Numbers**

* In signed binary, one bit is used as the sign bit, where `0` represents positive and `1` represents negative.
* **Two's Complement Representation**: Common method to represent signed binary numbers.
* To find the two's complement of a binary number, invert all bits and add `1` to the least significant bit (LSB).

**Example**: Representing `-5` in 4-bit twoâ€™s complement:

* Step 1: Convert `5` to binary: `0101`
* Step 2: Invert all bits: `1010`
* Step 3: Add `1`: `1011` (This is `-5` in two's complement).

#### Complements in Binary and Decimal Systems

Complements are useful in binary and decimal systems for performing arithmetic operations like subtraction using addition. Below are the explanations for **One's Complement**, **Two's Complement**, **Nine's Complement**, and **Ten's Complement**.



### Subtraction: ( 5 - 3 ) using Two's Complement

We know that subtraction can be represented as:

$$
5 - 3 = 5 + (-3)
$$

#### Step-by-step:

<table><thead><tr><th width="101">Step</th><th>Action</th><th>Explanation</th><th>Binary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Represent 5 in binary</td><td>Convert 5 to binary (4 bits)</td><td>( 0101 )</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Convert 3 to binary</td><td>Convert 3 to binary (4 bits)</td><td>( 0011 )</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Two's complement of 3</td><td>Invert bits of 3 (0011) and add 1</td><td>Invert: ( 0011 to 1100 ), then add 1: ( 1100 + 1 = 1101 )</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Add 5 and -3</td><td>Perform binary addition of ( 0101 + 1101 )</td><td>( 10010 )</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Discard the carry</td><td>Ignore the carry-over (MSB is discarded)</td><td>The result after discarding the carry: ( 0010 )</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Final result</td><td>Interpret the result</td><td>( 0010 ) is the binary representation of ( 2 ). Thus, ( 5 - 3 = 2 ).</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

### Subtraction: ( 3 - 5 ) using Two's Complement

We know that subtraction can be represented as:

$$
3 - 5 = 3 + (-5)
$$

#### Step-by-step:

<table><thead><tr><th width="86">Step</th><th>Action</th><th>Explanation</th><th>Binary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Represent 3 in binary</td><td>Convert 3 to binary (4 bits)</td><td>( 0011 )</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Convert 5 to binary</td><td>Convert 5 to binary (4 bits)</td><td>( 0101 )</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Two's complement of 5</td><td>Invert bits of 5 (0101) and add 1</td><td>Invert: ( 0101  to 1010 ), then add 1: ( 1010 + 1 = 1011 )</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Add 3 and -5</td><td>Perform binary addition of ( 0011 + 1011 )</td><td>( 1110 )</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Interpret the result</td><td>Convert the result from two's complement to decimal</td><td>Since the MSB is 1, the number is negative. Invert ( 1110 to 0001 ), add 1: ( 0001 + 1 = 0010 ), which is 2. The result is negative, so it's ( -2 ). Thus, ( 3 - 5 = -2 ).</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

**Summary Table:**

| Subtraction | Action       | Binary Result | Decimal Result |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| ( 5 - 3 )   | ( 5 + (-3) ) | ( 0010 )      | ( 2 )          |
| ( 3 - 5 )   | ( 3 + (-5) ) | ( 1110 )      | ( -2 )         |

**Remember:**&#x20;

In 1's complement, if there is a **carry-out** (i.e., an extra 1 in the 5th bit position), we discard the carry and add it back to the result (this is called **end-around carry**).

#### **For 1's Complement**:

* When the MSB is **1**, the number is negative.
* To convert it to a positive value, you **invert all the bits**.

#### **For 2's Complement**:

* When the MSB is **1**, the number is negative.
* To find the positive equivalent, you **invert all the bits** and **add 1** to the result.

#### Key takeaway:

* **MSB = 1** always indicates a negative number in both 1's complement and 2's complement.
* The difference is in how you process the negative number (invert bits and add 1 for 2's complement).

### Subtraction: ( 5 - 3 ) using 10's Complement

We know that subtraction can be represented as:

$$
5 - 3 = 5 + (-3)
$$

#### Step-by-step:

<table><thead><tr><th width="87">Step</th><th width="128">Action</th><th width="303">Explanation</th><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Represent 5 in binary</td><td>Convert 5 to binary (4 digits)</td><td>( 5 )</td><td>( 0101 )</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Represent 3 in binary</td><td>Convert 3 to binary (4 digits)</td><td>( 3 )</td><td>( 0011 )</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>10's complement of 3</td><td>Find 9's complement and add 1: ( 9 - 3 = 6 ); then add 1: ( 6 + 1 = 7 )</td><td>( -3 )</td><td>( 0111 )</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Add 5 and -3</td><td>Add the binary of 5 and the 10's complement of 3: ( 0101 + 0111 )</td><td>( 5 + (-3) )</td><td>( 1100 )</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Interpret the result</td><td>Since there's no carry, the result is the answer</td><td>( 2 )</td><td>( 0010 )</td></tr></tbody></table>

Final result:

$$
5 - 3 = 2 \quad \text{(in decimal, binary \( 0010 \))}
$$

### Subtraction: ( 3 - 5 ) using 10's Complement

We know that subtraction can be represented as:

$$
3 - 5 = 3 + (-5)
$$

#### Step-by-step:

<table><thead><tr><th width="95">Step</th><th width="118">Action</th><th width="295">Explanation</th><th width="90">Decimal</th><th>Binary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>Represent 3 in binary</td><td>Convert 3 to binary (4 digits)</td><td>( 3 )</td><td>( 0011 )</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Represent 5 in binary</td><td>Convert 5 to binary (4 digits)</td><td>( 5 )</td><td>( 0101 )</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>10's complement of 5</td><td>Find 9's complement and add 1: ( 9 - 5 = 4 ); then add 1: ( 4 + 1 = 5 )</td><td>( -5 )</td><td>( 0101 )</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Add 3 and -5</td><td>Add the binary of 3 and the 10's complement of 5: ( 0011 + 0101 )</td><td>( 3 + (-5) )</td><td>( 1000 )</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Interpret the result</td><td>Since the result is negative, invert ( 1000 ) (1's complement) to get ( 0111 ), then add 1: ( 0111 + 1 = 1000 ), so the result is ( -2 )</td><td>( -2 )</td><td>( 1110 )</td></tr></tbody></table>

Final result:

$$
3 - 5 = -2 \quad \text{(in decimal, binary \( 1110 \))}
$$

***

**Summary Table:**

| Subtraction | Action       | Binary Result | Decimal Result |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| ( 5 - 3 )   | ( 5 + (-3) ) | ( 0010 )      | ( 2 )          |
| ( 3 - 5 )   | ( 3 + (-5) ) | ( 1110 )      | ( -2 )         |

**Remember:**

In 9's complement, if there is a carry-out (i.e., an extra 1 in the 5th bit position), we discard the carry and add it back to the result (this is called end-around carry).&#x20;

#### **For 9's Complement**:

* When the **MSB** is **1**, the number is **negative**.
* To convert it to a positive value, you **subtract each bit from 9**. This means inverting each bit (for a 4-bit number, subtracting each bit from 9).

#### **For 10's Complement**:

* When the **MSB** is **1**, the number is **negative**.
* To find the positive equivalent, you **subtract each bit from 9**, and then **add 1** to the result. This is similar to how 2's complement works but with 9's complement instead.

#### Key takeaway:

* **MSB = 1** always indicates a **negative** number in both **9's complement** and **10's complement**.
* The difference is in how you process the negative number:
  * **9's complement**: Subtract each bit from 9.
  * **10's complement**: Subtract each bit from 9 and add 1 to the result.

### Conclusion

* Multiplexers (MUX), Demultiplexers (DEMUX), Decoders, and Encoders are essential components in digital circuits for managing data flow.&#x20;
* A multiplexer selects **one** input from multiple inputs and forwards it to a **single output** based on the control signals (selection lines). A demultiplexer takes **one** input and routes it to **one of several outputs** based on the control signals (selection lines). It essentially performs the inverse operation of a multiplexer.&#x20;
* Decoders convert binary inputs to specific outputs, and Encoders perform the reverse.
* Binary addition and subtraction follow base-2 rules with carry and borrow operations, similar to decimal.&#x20;
* Complements (1's, 2's, 9's, and 10's) are techniques used to simplify subtraction in both binary and decimal systems by converting subtraction into addition.
